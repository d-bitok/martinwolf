> People think in pages: users, authors, writers. You. Me. My mum. It’s a comfortable metaphor. We have the word ‘scroll’. There are web pages. A location on the web is talked about as having edges, and we all know that’s a problem that’s not getting any better with new devices with new screen resolutions and physical sizes. In swallowing the red pill of responsive design, we also need to feed that pill to our users, readers and producers of our content management systems. We need to start talking about content in terms of bits, not pages. And we need systems that help us think that way.

Great article about the needed change of Content Management Systems.
