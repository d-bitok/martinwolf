**Hello lovely reader. This was the beyondtellerrand week, which means I met a lot of people and didn&#8217;t read much. So the reading recommendations list is kinda short this week. I apologise but hope you like what I found. Have a great sunday!**

  * [Grouping related classes in your markup][1]  
    Interesting idea by CSSWizard Harry Roberts.
  * [Naming UI components in OOCSS][2]  
    And another one by Harry Roberts. This article is actually a month old but I somehow didn&#8217;t get around to reading it, but it is very good.
  * [How to keep believing in yourself][3]  
    Good advice by Kate Kendall
  * [beyondtellerrand 2014 Photos][4]  
    If you want more impressions from btconf before the videos are up, here is the Flickr pool.
  * [The Illusion of Motion][5]  
    Why we aim for 60fps in web development.
  * [Performance Budgeting With Grunt][6]  
    I haven&#8217;t tried it myself, but this sounds awesome and I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on this grunt task.
