> The first concept, that the site should work without media queries, was surprisingly natural to implement. The second concept, that content alone would determine the layoutâ€™s breakpoints, has had a much larger influence on me than I expected. Both with regards to this particular layout as well as in how I think about and approach responsive design in general.

Interesting article by Dave Olsen talking about some choices he made while redesigning his website and going responsive. The key here is that Dave used content-based breakpoints and how he describes tweakpoints. A term we&#8217;ll here more often in the future, I think.
