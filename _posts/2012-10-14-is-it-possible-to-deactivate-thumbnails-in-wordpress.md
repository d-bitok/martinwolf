Question by [Felix][1]:

> If you Upload a pictures with the WordPress Media Uploader, WordPress will automatically create some thumbnails of this picture.
> 
> Is it possible to deactivate this function for example with a plugin or in the code? Or maybe it is already deactivated within the new WordPress 3.5 Beta Media Uploader? :)

As far as I know there sadly is no such option in WordPress. However I found someone saying that if you set all image sizes to 0, it only generates one thumbnail that&#8217;s used for displaying the thumbnail in the WordPress Dashboard. Maybe that still works, good luck!
