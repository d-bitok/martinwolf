I recently had an idea for a simple content/box toggle. You click a button (+), it rolls to the right and stops in a position so it looks like a close icon (x). It then reveals the content. You click the close button, the content will be hidden and the buttons rolls back to the left.

The idea was to only use CSS animations and transitions (Javascript only for toggling classes), especially because I&#8217;m not that good with this fancy stuff. It was a nice exercise and I quite like the result. Even though it&#8217;s not perfect it shows my initial idea pretty well.
