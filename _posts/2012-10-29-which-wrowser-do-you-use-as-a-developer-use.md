So while I use Chrome most of the time for developing websites I also have an eye on the other browsers and regularly try the once mighty Firefox with Firebug. I also once did try Safari for a limited time. But I always come back to Chrome because it&#8217;s extremely fast, the UI looks good and the developer tools are great for my use.

Of course I do cross browser testing in all of the other browsers out there. Okay, not always in Opera, I have to admit. Shame on me.

**But today I don&#8217;t want to talk so much about me and my workflow. I want to ask you, what is your browser of choice as a developer and why?**
