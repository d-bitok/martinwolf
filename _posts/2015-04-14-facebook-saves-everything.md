>  I was inspecting Facebook's network traffic today in Firefox Devtools, when I realized that any text I put into the status update box was sent to Facebook's servers, even if I did not click the post button.

This is just unacceptable and another proof of what I've started to realise and finally taking action on.  
It's something I should have done a long time ago, so last week I started moving off of services that don't value my privacy.

Because of the social media impact Facebook has and my need to use it as a developer, I won't delete my account, but I will definitely change my behaviour on the platform and think twice what I enter into any field or upload to the network.
