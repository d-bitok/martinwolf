  Harry Roberts:

> I got everything set up a couple of days ago and fired a tweet out about how, for once, my desk looked presentable. I got a few replies asking me about a few things, so I thought I’d also put together a short post about my setup and the tools I use. I enjoy reading about other peoples’ setups, so I thought I might as well share my own.

Harry posted a nice overview about his new setup for working as a freelancer from home. Looks quite nice and I like how simple his software setup is. I&#8217;m not quite there yet, but I kick out more and more apps.
