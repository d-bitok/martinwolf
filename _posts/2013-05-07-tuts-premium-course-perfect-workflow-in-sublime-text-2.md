> I’m a confessed code editor addict, and have tried them all! I was an early adopter of Coda, a TextMate advocate, even a Vim convert. But all of that changed when I discovered Sublime Text 2, the best code editor available today. Don’t believe me? Let me convince you in this course.

There is no need to convince ME, but maybe you need some persuasion. Or maybe you already use Sublime Text 2 and just want to get better and more efficient with it. However, this Tuts+ video series is great.
