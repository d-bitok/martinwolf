The past week I was on vacation and I thought it&#8217;d be difficult to get a good amount of reading done so that I could present you a nice list with recommendations. But I was wrong, I did a lot of reading while relaxing when we came back from our daily tours and so I&#8217;m happy to present you a whole lot of awesome reading recommendations. Enjoy them!
