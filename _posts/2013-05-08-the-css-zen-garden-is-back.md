> So for the tenth anniversary, the Zen Garden is open for business once more. I’ve [thrown the codebase on Github][1], given the dusty copy a refresh, started the conversion of the site to HTML5, and brought all of the existing designs kicking and screaming into the modern age. The work isn’t done yet, but it’s a darn sight closer to how we would build it these days. If you see an area that needs help, consider sending a patch.

The CSS Zen Garden celebrated it&#8217;s 10th birthday yesterday and with it got reopened. This is exciting news.
