> Great news, everybody! Introducing: The Send to QUOTE.fm button.

Today we launched the [QUOTE.fm Button][1]. It lets you save the article you&#8217;re currently viewing for reading later, show the article right now in an clutter free environment, send it to your kindle (still in beta) or recommend it on QUOTE.fm.

We are really excited about this little product and hope that you make great use of it.

Not convinced, yet? Have a look at [theindustry.cc][2], our launch partner who already makes use of it.

If you have any questions, please ask so that we can help you as soon as possible.
