> The way I see it, the goal is to get to a point where you can walk into a carrier store, blindly pick up any device, fire up your project and behold it in all its glory. The goal is to get a point where your organization doesnâ€™t go into cardiac arrest every damn time Apple holds a keynote.

It&#8217;s really nearly impossible to keep up with all the devices out there so in my opinion that&#8217;s another point for building your sites less bound to specific devices.
