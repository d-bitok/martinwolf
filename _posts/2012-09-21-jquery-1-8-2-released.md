> We’re pleased to announce that jQuery 1.8.2 is available! This version fixes several bugs and performance regressions reported from the past couple of releases, and we think the 1.8 line is pretty solid at this point. The only way to know for sure that it works with your code is to test it–so please do!

Without the constant development of jQuery my life wouldn&#8217;t be so easy in regard to coding anything dynamic. Thanks!
