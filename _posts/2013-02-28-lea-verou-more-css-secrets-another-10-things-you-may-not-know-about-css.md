This one of the talks from W3Conf I linked yesterday. There are a few great CSS nuggets in there and I like that Lea is coding live. I really appreciate that and hope that more people will follow in her footsteps. It&#8217;s so much easier to follow along and understand what is going on. Especially if the code is getting a little bit complicated.
