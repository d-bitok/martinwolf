For the first time I forgot to post the Weekly Recap on sunday morning. I was on the road for a few days and got totally mixed up with the days. I&#8217;m sorry! So here we go. Weekly Recap of calendar week 26 of 2014. Happy reading.

  * [Get Off Your Ass & Get Noticed with Gary Vaynerchuk][1]  
    A brilliant episode of Chase Jarvis Live. Not exactly development related, but great advice in general. 
  * [A Webstandard It Is…][2]  
    It&#8217;s official, \`picture\`, \`srcset\` and \`sizes\` are now part of the HTML5 specification. Thank you all who contributed in any way. 
  * [Get comfortable.][3]  
    Speaking advice from Dan Mall, who I&#8217;ve seen presenting and he was very comfortable. 
  * [Trent Walton trying to read an article on rollingstone.com][4]  
    Hilarious and sad at the same time. 
  * [Vim for people who think things like Vim are weird and hard][5]  
    Harry Roberts wrote about why you want to use Vim. Just a day before his article I started using Vim and also bombarded him with a few questions. Not easy getting started but I&#8217;ll keep going. 
  * [Beta.CanIUse.com][6]  
    The new Design and underlying improvements of CanIUse.com are online. They will be available as the beta version for a few weeks before replacing the current site. Looking forward to it. 
  * [Stop Asking Me to “Sign Up”][7]  
    How to easily increase your sign-up-rate. 
  * [Biz Stone on the early days of Twitter: &#8216;You can be nice and successful at the same time&#8217;][8]  
    Nice interview with Biz Stone. 
  * [Pay it forward][9]  
    Great advice on the intersection of life and work. Provide value without demanding anything in return. Be a good person. 
  * [Life after beta launch][10]  
    finch finally has a blog and Nick Payne talks about the recent development and what&#8217;s to come. Never heard of finch? Go check it out.
