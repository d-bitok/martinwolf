> I’ve just launched pre-sales for Offscreen Issue No4. It’s now for sale here and you should either buy a single copy or extend your subscription. Shipping starts Jan 21st or a few days earlier.

From today on you can and should pre-order Issue 04 of Offscreen Magazine. The only print magazine I regularly read.
