> Does Apple—and the rest of the WebKit community—have the skill and capacity to continue to drive WebKit forward at a pace that matches Google’s grand plans for Blink? The easy answer is, “Of course it does! Apple created the WebKit project, and it got along fine before Google started contributing.” But I look at those graphs and wonder.

Thoughts on Apple, Google, WebKit, Blink, Android, Facebook, Samsung. Who owns what, who drives which project forward the most, and so on. Interesting read.
