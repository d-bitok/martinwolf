> By 2015, more Americans will access the internet through mobile devices than through desktop computers, according to a prediction by International Data Corporation. Some of these people may still have access to the desktop web, but, for reasons of context, ease, or sheer laziness, will choose their mobile first. For others, there will be no other way to view your content.

> For this growing population, if your content doesn’t exist on the mobile screen, it doesn’t exist at all.

That the mobile web user percentage is constantly growing is nothing new.  
On the one hand I&#8217;m already sick of the topic but on the other hand there are so much people out there who don&#8217;t understand it, yet. So I&#8217;ll keep pushing forward and promoting good articles about optimizing your content for mobile devices.
