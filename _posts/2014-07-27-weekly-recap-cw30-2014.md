This week was full of CSS goodness, a week entirely to my taste. I hope you like it, too. So let&#8217;s not waste too much time and get right into it. Enjoy!

  * [Ten CSS One-Liners to Replace Native Apps][1]  
    HÃ¥kon Wium Lie, the father of CSS, talks about paged, column layouts of websites and how the future could look. Interesting stuff.
  * [RWD Bloat][2]  
    Dave Rupert analyses how much page weight is generated by making his own site responsive. Nice insights.
  * [GitHub&#8217;s CSS][3]  
    Mark Otto talks about all things CSS at GitHub. Nice look behind the scenes.
  * [CSS at Lonely Planet][4]  
    Another nice behind the scenes look. I hope there will be more of these posts in the future.
  * [Optimising for 60fps everywhere][5]  
    GoSquared set themselves the goal of 60fps for every animation and here are some insights how they got there.
  * [Critical][6]  
    Addy Osmani is working on a tool that will help you extract & inline Critical-path CSS from HTML. And here is a [sample project][7] with gulpjs.
  * [A Note to Our Readers][8]  
    The New Yorker launched a new responsive site. Well done!
  * [Tower 2 is Here][9]  
    The new version of probably the best and most extensive Mac git client was released. Looks good.
  * [Responsive Logos][10]  
    Awesome examples of responsive SVG logos which adapt their looks based on the size.
  * [iOS SDK Release Notes for iOS 8.0 Beta 4][11]  
    The interesting part: The minimal-ui viewport property is no longer supported.
