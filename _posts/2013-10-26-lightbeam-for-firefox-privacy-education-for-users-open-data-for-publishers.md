> Lightbeam is an add-on for Firefox that brings to light the array of first and third party companies people interact with everyday across the Web.

Lightbeam seems like a very interesting and educational add-on for Firefox. In general I really like what Mozilla and the Firefox team is doing and what they stand for. I just wish their browser would be a little bit faster, especially the actual browser chrome/ui.
