Hello and welcome to the Whitsunday edition of the Weekly Recap. In Germany the summer has started with full force and it&#8217;s perfect to take your favourite reading device outside and start exploring the following reading recommendations. Have a nice day!

  * [`picture` element support in Chrome 38][1]  
    If everything goes it&#8217;s way, we should have a fully functional `picture` implementation in Chrome 38 in September.
  * [Making your site more mobile-friendly with PageSpeed Insights][2]Updated PageSpeed Insights. Nice!
  * [Using Encapsulation for Semantic Markup][3]  
    One of many use cases for the Shadow DOM.
  * [Introducing webcompat.com][4]  
    Mozilla is working on a place to file bugs and issues on all the things web.
  * [Picturefill 2.1.0 Beta][5]  
    New version of the `picture` polyfill.
  * [Mat Marquis says thank you][6]  
    This is for everyone who somehow contributed to making a native `srcset` and `picture` implementation possible.
  * [Inside Medium][7]  
    Photographer Darren Hull spent one day at the Medium office and documented everything in 140 pictures. Looks really nice.
  * [Better font-rendering on OSX][8]  
    How to optimise the display of fonts for webkit/blink and Firefox on OSX.
  * [Preview the “Press This” Bookmarklet Redesign, Alpha Plugin Now Ready for Testing][9]  
    There is a new version of the WordPress &#8220;Press This&#8221; bookmarklet on it&#8217;s way. While I posted mostly linked list post, I used it heavily and I think a revamp is a good decision.
  * [PSD Viewing & Diffing][10]  
    GitHub now treats PSD files like jpg&#8217;s or other image files and let&#8217;s you see diffs. That&#8217;s pretty great.
  * [Ditch Your Office Chair for a New ‘Standing Desk’][11]  
    Sitting all day long is bad for your health, so I&#8217;m currently using my kitchen table as a standing desk for a few hours a day and I really enjoy it.
