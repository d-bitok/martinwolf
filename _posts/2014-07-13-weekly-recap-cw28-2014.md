Hey folks, I hope you had a lovely week and got some time to finish it off with reading a couple of fine articles. Enjoy!

  * [Pinboard Turns Five][1]  
    My favourite bookmarking service turns five and it&#8217;s owner, Maciej, wrote a few nice words.
  * [Simplicity][2]  
    Another great post from Bastian. He expresses exactly what I feel.
  * [My first week with the Vim text editor][3]  
    Like me, Ben Frain recently switched to Vim, trying to understand how to use it the most effectively. Interesting write-up of his first week.
  * [&#8220;RWD Is Bad for Performance&#8221; Is Good for Performance][4]  
    Tim Kadlec shows how we can take advantage of this ever lasting rumor.
  * [Startup weekend write-up][5]  
    Florian, a good friend of mine, participated in the Startup Weekend Hamburg and won. Here is what he has learned.
  * [Behold, the Fold][6]  
    The never ending story of the Fold.
  * [Meeting your users wherever they are][7]  
    Scott Jehl on the Pastry Box Project.
  * [News.im][8]  
    You like both HackerNews and DesignerNews? This is for you.
