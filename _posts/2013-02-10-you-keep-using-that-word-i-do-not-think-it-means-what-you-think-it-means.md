> I have a few keyword searches on Twitter I like to check daily for new articles on this and that, though one trend that really has caught my attention recently is seeing more and more authors writing about techniques like mobile first, adaptive web design, and RESS and many others terms with what seems to be a misconception of these terms.

Not sure you know what all those fancy words and abbreviations you read all day on twitter mean? Have a look at this list, can&#8217;t hurt.
