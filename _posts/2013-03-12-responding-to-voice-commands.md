Jordan Moore set up a fun experiment in which you can speak to the website and it responds accordingly. For example there are commands like *&#8220;Make the font bigger&#8221;* or *&#8220;Make it darker&#8221;*. It&#8217;s currently only working in Chrome and I had trouble getting it to work. That&#8217;s either due to my bad english or the bad speech recognition currently used in Chrome. However it&#8217;s a cool test and it might be a big thing in the future, thinking of accessibility.
