> We just added a load of features you asked about: LESS, SASS Compass, Stylus, font properties and syntax highlighting are all looking forward to enhance your latest website!

CSS Hat is a very useful Photoshop Plugin that generates CSS/LESS/SASS for you. It works really good but nevertheless I like writing my own code. However, they just updated the plugin with support for LESS and SASS and more which is really cool.
