> Carefully constructed documentation is the difference between a feature being prototyped quickly or it being becoming a bottleneck. Its the difference between 10 people being able to progress that feature or just one and its the difference between CSS becoming a mess or CSS keeping a consistent architecture.

To this point I never created a documentation for my projects but I plan to do in the future and so should you, especially if you work in a team. Maybe the tools recommended in this article will help me and you in the future.
