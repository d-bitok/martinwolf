> Hereâ€™s an unobtrusive crossbrowser solution for checkbox and radio button styling that does not use any vendor-specific properties such as (-webkit-appearance), but relies entirely on official CSS properties and no JavaScript at all.

You don&#8217;t like the standard look of checkboxes and radio buttons? You love doing as much as possible with pure CSS? Then you&#8217;re the kind of person who should read this article. I use this technique for QUOTE.fm and it works. It&#8217;s not the greatest thing in the world but better than working with jQuery UI stuff or something like that. But have in mind that this method doesn&#8217;t support IE8 or lower.
