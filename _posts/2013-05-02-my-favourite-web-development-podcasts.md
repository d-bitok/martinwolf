**I listen to a whole bunch of web development related podcasts on a more or less regular basis.**

I mostly do that while commuting to and from work and it&#8217;s a nice way to get to know some people on the web and learn new things.

I made a list of my favourite ones and I hope a few of them are new to you and you&#8217;ll enjoy listening to them as much as I do. So here we go:

### [ShopTalkShow][1]

This is a podcast all about frontend web design and development hosted by the web dreamteam Chris Coyier and Dave Rupert. It&#8217;s definitely my favorite web development podcast out there. They usually have a guest and talk about him/her and answer user questions. There are also special Rapidfire episodes in which the two punch through as many listener questions as possible.

### [The Big Web Show][2]

The grandfather of the web, Jeffrey Zeldman, talks to all the cool and smart people on the web. There is absolutely nothing you couldn&#8217;t like about this podcast.

Andy Clarke and Anna Debenham are a great team so co-host this brilliant podcast about all things web business related. Don&#8217;t fear, it&#8217;s really funny and not boring business talk.

### [Happy Monday][4]

A relatively short, but fast paced podcast co-hosted by Josh Long and Sarah Parmenter. Makes mondays happier.

### [The East Wing][5]
