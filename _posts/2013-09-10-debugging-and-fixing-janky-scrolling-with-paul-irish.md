Paul Irish takes a look at the scrolling behavior of [theex.com][1] and improves the implementation so scrolling will look really smooth. He uses the Chrome DevTools Timeline, shows how to use paint rectangles and uses LiveEdit with V8.

I&#8217;m not very familiar with all those DevTools Analytics Tools and am very curious to learn more in this field so I really enjoyed this video by Paul.
