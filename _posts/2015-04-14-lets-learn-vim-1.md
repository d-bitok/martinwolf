I've decided to start a series of screencasts on vim. I want to teach you the basics of vim and get you excited for it. Since I'm   still a vim beginner, too, I hope to explain simple words what might be hard to understand in the beginning.

The videos will be 5-10 minutes long each, so you can watch them in a short break.

After I explained all the basic things and get you up to an reasonable speed I hope to continue the series with showing you things I learn along the way.

In this first video I show you the three different modes in which to operate vim and how to navigate inside your files.
