> We love that neat little "pull to refresh" feature on our devices, but wouldnt it be awesome if it was for the web? Well, thats what Hook is here to do.

A while ago I thought about building exactly that. Pull to refresh for websites. In a few Mac apps this is already integrated and I caught myself doing this in the browser, too. Especially with the Trackpad.  
So this is a simple script that Jordan Singer and Brandon Jacoby build, that does exactly that. But after a few times using it I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s a good thing for websites to use. But nevertheless, it&#8217;s pretty cool.
