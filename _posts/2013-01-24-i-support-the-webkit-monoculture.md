> Imagine if all of the Gecko developers left and joined forces with WebKit? Both projects are (imperfectly) trying to adhere to W3C standards, so fragmentation due to inconsistencies would diminish significantly. Imagine if Firefox switched to WebKit &#8211; it would free up a ton of time spent fixing Firefox bugs. Donâ€™t get me wrong, a world without browser-specific bugs is a pipe dream. But standardizing on a single rendering engine would go a long way towards unifying the web.
