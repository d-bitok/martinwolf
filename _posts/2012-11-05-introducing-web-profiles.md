> Web profiles will launch to all Instagram users in the next week or so. If you can’t see your profile yet, rest assured that you’ll see it in the next few days.

It&#8217;s about time. Instagram rolls out web profiles. I&#8217;m so much looking forward to this. On the linked page above you will find my profile soon. Until then you can learn a few things about what the new web profiles have to offer. If you want to see how they&#8217;ll look, you can already visited [@nike][1], [@cucinadigitale][2], [@mycookingdiary][3] or [@palomaparrot][4]. I love it.
