> Back when I first started this blog, and in turn using WordPress, the most annoying part of blogging was WordPress&#8217; auto-formatting. Â WordPress would strip out custom attributes, mess with my DIV and paragraph structure, and just generally raise havoc. It bugged me so much that since the inception of this blog, I&#8217;ve been creating the HTML for blog posts myself.

Sounds familiar to you? Then removing the `autop` filter will save your world.
