> Today, were introducing a new design for both Like and Share to help people share more great content across the web. Were already seeing a favorable increase in Likes and Shares with the new design and will be rolling these buttons out to everyone in the coming weeks.

This is a big step for Facebook. It&#8217;s the first time they change the like button since it&#8217;s introduction. I think I like the new, more eye-catching design. Generally nice to see something new. Grew a little tired of the old like button. But I guess it&#8217;ll be the same with this one very soon.
