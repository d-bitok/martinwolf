> CSS has been lacking proper layout mechanisms for far too long. Transitions, animations, filters, all of these are great and useful additions to the language, but they don&#8217;t address the major problems that Web developers have been complaining about for what seems like an eternity.

With Flexbox we have a solution to many layout challenges. Philip put together a really awesome site showcasing what Flexbox can do and which problems it solves for you. Thank you!
