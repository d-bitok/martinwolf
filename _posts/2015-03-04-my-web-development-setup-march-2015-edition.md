**In June 2014 I wrote [an article](http://martinwolf.org/2014/06/20/my-setup/) about my Web Development Setup. It was received very well and the post still gets a bunch of hits, so I thought it’s time to revisit it and post an updated version. A lot of things stayed the same, a few have changed though.**

## Hardware

### MacBook Air 13”
I’m still using my trusty old Mid 2012 MacBook Air. I can feel that it’s getting older because the CPU workload gets maxed out quite often and the battery life suffered dramatically.

I’m waiting for the next Apple event, supposedly March 9th, and hope for new MacBooks. Not sure whether I’ll stick with an Air or if I might be switching to an 15” MacBook Pro so I can work more efficiently when I’m not hooked up to an external display. 13” are nice to travel with, but it’s not quite enough space for working on it for a longer period of time.

### 27” Cinema Display
My external display of choice remains the 27” Cinema Display which still does its job. I’m having an eye on the emerging ultra wide screen displays, but am not tempted to buy one, yet.

### KUL ES-87 Mechanical Keyboard (Brown Cherry MX)
I switched to an english keyboard layout and started to enjoy mechanical keyboards. I chose the [KUL ES-87](http://martinwolf.org/2014/11/20/new-mechanical-keyboard/) with Brown Cherry MX switches. It’s a pleasure to type on and I find the english keyboard layout much better for coding. Getting used to the new layout surprisingly didn’t take very long and I encourage you to give it a try. But do it on a real english hardware layout, otherwise it can be really frustrating. I still have to use the german keyboard of my MacBook with an english software layout - it works but it can be annoying sometimes.

### Razer DeathAdder Chroma, Magic Trackpad
I’m a big fan of the internal Trackpad of MacBooks, but somehow I don’t really like the external Magic Trackpad. Not sure what’s the problem. Might be the size, the angle or just the position next to the keyboard instead of below it. So I just switched to a Razer DeathAdder Chroma mouse. I always loved the Logitech MX series, but my G400 doesn’t work well with OS X and I have a lot of other Razer gear on my Windows PC which has always done a great job, so I chose a DeathAdder. I think I’m going to enjoy it.

### Apple iPhone 6
As every year in autumn I switched to the newest iPhone. I chose the 6 over the 6 Plus. It’s cheaper and I was already worried about the size of the regular 6 so I don’t wanted to give the 6 Plus a try. Still not sure what to think of the trend of big phones. But I recently held a 6 Plus in my hands and the display is really gorgeous.

### Apple Retina iPad Mini
I sold the regular iPad Mini and kept the one with Retina Display. I use it for testing as well as watching Netflix, reading, etc.

### Samsung Galaxy Nexus
I still have this Android test device and I still need at least one more Android phone for testing. Shame on me that I haven’t bought one yet.

### AKG K550 headphones
Wonderfully soft and the sound is awesome. At least for my ears. Will probably keep them until they break.

### Windows PC
I use my Windows PC for gaming as well as testing. Over the past months I upgraded the graphics card to an EVGA GeForce GTX 970 Superclocked ACX 2.0. It’s a beast and lets me play Battlefield 4 and Dota 2 on 120 fps.

## Software

### vim, tmux and iTerm 2
While I’ve always enjoyed Sublime Text and still think it’s the best regular text editor out there for web development, I switched to using [vim](http://www.vim.org/about.php) pretty much exclusively.

It took me a good while to understand it and learning a lot of the basic commands but now I love it. I use it in combination with [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) and my command line app of choice still remains iTerm 2. I feel comfortable using vim now, but there is still sooooo much to learn. I think that’s part of the fun. It’s basics are so easy and straight forward but there is basically no limit to what you can do with it and how fast you can be. I’m just fascinated by it.

### Browsers
I constantly switch between browsers. Partly because I’m unsatisfied with everyone in one or the other way and partly because I test sites in different browsers constantly. I don’t use a lot of Browser extensions besides 1Password and some sort of Ad Blocker and bookmarks are stored on Pinboard, so switching isn’t a big deal. I probably want to use Firefox most of the time, because it looks good, supports standards and I feel aligned with what Mozilla stands for, but it still has it’s performance issues.

All in all I think it’s important for a web developer to remember that we are not living in a browser mono culture and that there is more than Chrome out there.

### Git
All of what I do is still version controlled by git. That’s a necessity. All of my projects live on GitHub as private repos. Some of them have multiple remotes and are also stored on my own server.

### gulp.js
Gulp is my task runner/build tool. I use it in all of my new projects and I think there is only one older site that still uses Grunt just because I’m too lazy to convert it.

### Browsersync
I used LiveReload to automatically reload a site or inject CSS into a site when I change a file, but [Browsersync](http://browsersync.io/) (as a gulp task) is even better and can do things like sync scroll position and form inputs between browsers. It’s like magic. You have to try it.

### MAMP Pro
Nothing has changed. I use MAMP to run my local dev environment when I need PHP and MySQL. It works problem-free and besides from starting it I never see anything of it.

### Sequel Pro
From time to time I have to dig into a MySQL Database, that’s when I use Sequel Pro. Never had any issues with it. Works when I need it.

### WordPress
I put that into the Software category. Even though this site is now build with Jekyll, WordPress is my CMS of choice for pretty much anything. I know it since the early days and I know how to built fast, easy to use sites with it.

### Jekyll
As mentioned, this site currently is built with the static site generator Jekyll. Works without any problems and is perfect for small, simple sites that only a tech-savvy person has to manage.

### SnapRuler
Still at my side and only a shortcut away. I use it to measure things on screen.

### DoublePane
The most simple window manager. I’ve hidden everything of it and it loads on system startup. It lets me position windows on the left and right half of the screen as well as make them fullscreen or revert them back to their original state. While trying out a more powerful software, BetterSnapTool, I found DoublePane is really all I need.

### Evernote
Important Documents and quick notes all live in my Evernote. There’s not more to say about it.

### OmniFocus 2 / GitHub Issues
The projects I work on are not too big and the amount of projects I take on simultaneously is mostly rather low, so I don’t have to rely heavily on task and project management apps, but if I do, I use OmniFocus 2. I also had great success using GitHub Issues together with a client as a task and project manager.

### Creative Cloud
There is no way around it. I need Photoshop and even Illustrator from time to time. Being able to sync Typekit fonts to my Mac is a nice addition.

### Sketch
Recently more and more designers use Sketch, so I bought it too to be able to open their files. I’ve also used it for my own and it’s really easy and fun to use.

### Airmail 2
I was a big fan of using GMail in the browser but since I split up my private and work mails I use Airmail 2 to easily manage both mail accounts at the same time. If I choose to switch into the browser for whatever reason, I use Google Inbox.

### Sunrise
Not long ago I switched to Sunrise to manage my Google Calendar. It works fine on Mac as well as on iOS and I like it more than any other Calendar app I’ve tried in the past.

### iA Writer / Writer Pro
If I’m not writing right in WordPress or vim, I usually reach for either iA Writer or Writer Pro. I actually am typing this post in Writer Pro.

## Browser Extensions

I don’t use any for development purposes any more. LiveReload has been replaced by Browsersync, for which I don’t need an extension and the Dev Tools of all browsers are so good that in my opinion there is no need for Firebug or any other additional tool. In Chrome I’ve installed PageSpeed Insights, but I often go to the [Web version](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) regardless.

Other than that I’ve installed 1Password in every browser as well as an Ad blocker.

## Services

### PageSpeed Insights / Webpagetest
Developing fast and easy to use websites is not just a nice-to-have, it’s one of the most important things. While I know a lot of things to optimise the sites I built by hard, it’s always good to double check with [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) and [Webpagetest](http://webpagetest.org/) to find potential problems or bottlenecks.

### Cushion
[Cushion](http://cushionapp.com) is a small web app which helps me plan projects and financial goals as well as track invoices. It’s exactly what I need and I’m supporting it since the early paid beta and it gets better every couple of weeks.

### Meet Finch
I don’t need it very often, but when I do it just works. [Finch](https://meetfinch.com/) lets me share my local development site with anyone anywhere with a simple url. It’s prefect to quickly show progress to a client, get help from a friend or just to have a look at the site on a couple of different devices.

### Selfhosted Shout IRC
Being part of an active IRC channel with other developers and designers keeps me sane while being alone at home working most of the day. I use [Shout IRC](http://shout-irc.com/), hosted on my own server as my client. Most of the time as a fluid app.

### Dropbox
Almost all of my files live in my Dropbox. I upgraded to Dropbox Pro and now have 1 TB of storage and it’s awesome.

### GitHub
As mentioned earlier I host pretty much all of my project files in git repositories on GitHub.

### Spotify / Soundcloud
I always heard music while working but recently I’ve cut back on that to go easy on my ears. I heard or rather sometimes still hear noises on one ear and while it can and probably has dozens of reasons, not hearing music all day (with headphones) is probably a good idea. I have to learn to treat my body better than I sometimes have done in the past. However, I use Spotify and Soundcloud whenever I need music.

### Feedly/Reeder
I still use RSS. Not as much as a few years ago, but I still like it. I have a Feedly Account but use it pretty much always through Reeder on my Mac or iOS.

### Instapaper
I save and read longer articles in Instapaper. Works well since it has launched.

### GMail & Google Calendar
My mail accounts as well as my calendars are hosted by Google even though that almost never shows anywhere because I don’t use the @gmail addresses. I receive on my own domains and sent with an alias.
