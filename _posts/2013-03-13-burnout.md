Laura Kalbag about something we should all be aware of: Burnout.

> Spending hours just staring into space when youâ€™re supposed to be doing work, when you want to be doing work. Feeling foggy-headed and grey the whole time when you usually feel eager and excitable. Menial tasks are just about manageable, but anything requiring careful consideration or creative thinking feels impossible. I sleep but I still feel tired.
