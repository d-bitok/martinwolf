If you, like me, can&#8217;t attend [An Event Apart Atlanta][1], that is currently happening, you&#8217;ll like what is coming now:  
Jeremy Keith writes detailed summaries of the talks held at the event. I haven&#8217;t had the chance to read them all but it seems like it&#8217;s totally worth it. Thank you, Jeremy!

The list so far:

  * [10 Commandments of Web Design by Jeffrey Zeldman][2]
  * [Strong Layout Systems by Eric Meyer][3]
  * [Billboards and Novels by Jon Tan][4]
  * [Itâ€™s a Write/Read Mobile Web by Luke Wroblewski][5]
  * [Responsive and Responsible by Scott Jehl][6]
  * [Designing for Touch by Josh Clark][7]
