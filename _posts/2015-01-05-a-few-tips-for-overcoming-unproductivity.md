**A fews weeks before christmas I had really trouble concentrating and overall motivating myself. Getting new projects didn&#8217;t go so well and I was a little depressed which made it even worse. I know that everybody goes through these phases but that only did help a little. Here are a few things which helped me get back on track and hopefully one or another will help you too if you get in a similar situation like I did. Or maybe you just need a little kick starter after a nice vacation over the new year.**

## Seinfeld List

This method of tracking oneself is named after the comedian Jerry Seinfeld who reportedly did invent this list, even though he once declined that. Anyhow, what you do is, you create a table and write down the calendar dates in the most left column and the things you want to track/do every day in the first row. And every day if you&#8217;ve done the task you check the according box. The idea is that over time you can see how well you&#8217;ve done and that it&#8217;s harder for you to neglect a task if you see that you&#8217;ve done it for the past days in a row. For me that works very well. I use a Google Drive Spreadsheet which looks like this:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3316" srcset="http://martinwolf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tDmafuldv.png 710w, http://martinwolf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tDmafuldv.png 1420w, http://martinwolf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tDmafuldv-360x192.png 360w, http://martinwolf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tDmafuldv.png 720w, http://martinwolf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tDmafuldv-280x150.png 280w, http://martinwolf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tDmafuldv.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 4rem), (max-width: 900px) calc(((100vw - 2rem) * 0.666) - 2rem), 710px" /> 

The yellow rows are weekends. I also started to mark holidays green.

## Pomodoro

The pomodoro techqnique is quite popular and you might have already heard of it. The basic idea is that you work uninterrupted for 25 minutes, then make a short break for 5 minutes, check Twitter, make a coffee, do whatever you want, then work for another uninterrupted 25 mins, take a short break, work 25 mins, short break, work 25 min and after four so called pomodoros you take a longer break. Half an hour is a good length.

I use the Mac menubar app Tomighty to track the time and remind me of the end of work period or break. To make it work you really need to turn off everything distracting while you are in work mode. Thats crucial. You can do all this in the break times. It worked really really well for me and helped me getting things done and I felt really pleased with myself after the work periods.

## noisli.com

In combination with the pomodoro technqiue is used noisli.com to ease me into work mode. I normally always hear music while working. But from time to time I can&#8217;t find the right tunes and it distracts me from doing my job. But I don&#8217;t like it when it&#8217;s completely quite. In comes [noisli.com][1]. Noisli lets you tune in different ambient sounds at once. There are coffee shop sounds (talking people, coffee cup clanks, etc.), rain sounds, thunderstorms and much more. You can tune in several sounds at once and even adjust the volume of each one. For me the Coffee Shop with light rain worked really well.

## Single Tasking/Fullscreen Windows

I mostly work on a 27&#8243; Cinema Display but every so often I&#8217;m overwhelmed with the amount of space which leads to several windows overlapping each other and distracting me. It sounds like a silly problem, but I often tend to work better if I can only see one window at a time. I use a tool to snap windows to the left or right half of the display or to esaily maximise it but these sizes weren&#8217;t always the ones I was looking for. So I created a Custom Snap Area with BetterSnapTool in the center of the screen with the dimensions of a 24&#8243; monitor which seems to be the sweet spot for me. It&#8217;s 1920px wide and 100% height. I often just snap all my windows to that area and I kinda work in 24&#8243; fullscreen mode on a 27&#8243; display. Sounds weird, but it helps me focus when I&#8217;m all over the place with windows and thoughts.

## Sublime Text 3/your editor of choice

Over the last couple of months I tried out vim. I really started to like it but more often than not it consumed so much mental energy just to work with the tool that I realized there wasn&#8217;t enough left to do my work really well and above all efficient. The advantages and disadvantages of vim shouldn&#8217;t be the topic of this post, so I only say so much for now: I&#8217;m back to Sublime Text 3 just because it lets me use my mental energy for the actual work instead of wasting it for learning a new tool. After all the output is what matters, not the tool you used to create it.

## Music

As I said, I almost always listen to music while working and depending on my mood or the task at hand I need a different kind of music. I have a few playlists and artists which really help me getting shit done. Just a few of these tracks I once put together in this [Soundcloud playlist][2] which really helps me if I need to get in the zone.

## Get your act together

You want to be a professional. So get your shit together and get to work. Whatever it is you want or need to do, start. That&#8217;s often the hardest part of it all and after that it will go easier. Start somewhere, don&#8217;t overthink it, get to work and ease your way in. Do a small task, reward yourself, do another. And if you are done and content with yourself, turn off and enjoy you free time. And the next day, you start again. Keep going. We are all in the same boat, we all have tasks to do we don&#8217;t like. No matter if you work in a small agency, for yourself or if you&#8217;ve won a couple of awards. Sometimes it&#8217;s hard even though we love our job and the web.
