> Being able to adjust a single component based on its current layout is extremely powerful. It allows more re-usability of code, and it encourages designers to think about how an individual component adapts on its own, outside of any given layout. Decoupling individual content components from their layout is a key principle of OOCSS, and this encourages that principle.

Great idea by Andy Hume. He proposes a way for using media queries on single elements. So you could changed an element if its width is smaller than a certain size and not only if the whole viewport is smaller than the given number. This would really increase the reusability of code. Buzzword: OOCSS.
