> Blatantly copying the excerpt of the pull quote into itâ€™s own element is not the way to go. A pull quote is a purely visual technique, and therefore should not change the structure of the body. Next to that, a structural representation of the excerpt would be seen twice by people using feed readers or services like Instapaper, as well as be re-read for people who use screen readers. So how can we best author this into our mark-up?

Very clever way of implementing pull quotes using a data-attribute and a pseudo class. I tink I&#8217;ll use this technique in upcoming interviews. Thanks Maykel!
