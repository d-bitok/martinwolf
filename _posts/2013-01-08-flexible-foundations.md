  Trent Walton:

> I should be focused on making things truly scalable by thinking twice before I used pixel values in my CSS. Perhaps that’s what RWD really should be defined as in the end—sites built on a fully-flexible foundation enhanced by media queries.

I read so much stuff about responsive web development and design that I can&#8217;t hear it anymore, but this article by Trent Walton is truly great. It&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s on the point and it hase great examples. Go read it and start using relative units in your CSS more often than pixel values. I try to do it, too.  
And even if you are as sick as me of the whole topic, keep spreading the word. We need every web developer to adapt this future proof approach.
