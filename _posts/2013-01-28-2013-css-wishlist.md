**After Chris Coyier posted his [wishlist for CSS in 2013][1], I thought I chime in and write down my own wishes. There are also a few analogies, which is no surprise.**

### Element media queries

Or as Andy Hume called it: [Responsive containers][2].  
Basically you&#8217;d be able to do something like this, which would increase portability of website modules.

<pre><code class="language-css">.promotion (max-width: 300px) {
  font-size: 0.8em;
}</code></pre>

### Multiple pseudo elements

I love using pseudo-elements in all kinds of situations. They are a really mighty tool for styling purposes for which you don&#8217;t want to create extra markup. I have no idea if it&#8217;s even possible to introduce more pseudo-elements than two, but it would be a welcome addition. Could look like this:

<pre><code class="language-css">.class:pseudo {
  // styles
}

.class:pseudo(2) {
  // styles
}

.class:pseudo(3) {
  // styles
}

.class:pseudo(4) {
  // styles
}</code></pre>

### Select element, that contains a certain element or class

If you write CSS you always go down the DOM tree, although the browser does is the other way round when rendering your CSS. So you can select all `img` tags which are inside `a` tags, but you can&#8217;t select `a` tags which contain `img` tags. But this would come in handy from time to time.  
This could look like that:

<pre><code class="language-css">a(contains:img) {
  background: #ccc;
}</code></pre>

### CSS calculations

I know, CSS isn&#8217;t a programming language and we have CSS calculation options through preprocessors, but ideally CSS itself would support it and we could do things like:

<pre><code class="language-css">.container {
  width: 100%-20px;
  height: 40%+30px;
}</code></pre>

### Flexbox

[Flexbox][3] will come eventually, but I think sooner than later would be better.

### Perfect rendering of CSS shapes in all browsers

As often as I possibly can I try to avoid images and instead build stuff with pure CSS. As mentioned above multiple pseudo-elements would help taking things a step further.  
But another problem is that not everything looks good in every browser. For example do look some CSS triangles very smooth in Chrome but the same ones have jagged lines in Firefox. Generally small forms do look better than big ones. So I think there is definitely room for improvement.

### Conclusion

But even if none of my wishes will be fulfilled this year, I still love what CSS is capable of and how much of it we can actually use in real projects. Not too long ago we still had problems with `border-radius` or `box-shadow`. So if browsers get updated at this pace in the future, we are all just fine, I think.
