> Lots of non-responsive websites are using the viewport tag without noticing how harmful it can be for the users, or they are using some of the viewport parameters "just because somebody copied and pasted them there". Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case; as web designers and developers, we tend to rely too much on frameworks and templates, sometimes adding lots of extra code the website will use for nothing, and sometimes adding complex configuration lines the project doesn&#8217;t really need. It&#8217;s time to recover control over our websites: never add a line of code you don&#8217;t really understand, never add a line of code you don&#8217;t really need.

Word. Everything you need to know about the viewport meta tag put in simple words.  
I&#8217;ve to say that I use `user-scalable=no` if I&#8217;m sure that there will be no need to scale the site. That might not be the perfect approach because we never ever can be 100% sure. So I&#8217;ll reconsider that.
