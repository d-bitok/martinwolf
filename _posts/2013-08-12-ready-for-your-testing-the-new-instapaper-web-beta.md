> When the betaworks team sat down with Instapaper’s creator, Marco Arment, back in April to get a download of his ideas and to-dos for improving Instapaper, the first thing on his list was to update the Instapaper website. Well we’ve done it, and it’s now ready for you to check out and test.

The new beta web user interface looks really promising. I highly recommend you to check it out here: [beta.instapaper.com][1]
