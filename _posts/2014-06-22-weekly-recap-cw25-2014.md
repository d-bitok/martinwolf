Hello and welcome to the Web Dev Recap of calendar week 25 in 2014. This week I collected a long a list of things I can recommend you reading or watching. I suggest you better get started right now:

  * [Creative Exhaust][1]  
    Great TEDx talk by Brad Frost.
  * [AMA: I&#8217;m Frank Chimeroâ€”a designer, writer, speaker, and picturemaker person.][2]  
    Although this isn&#8217;t a development article, it&#8217;s very interesting and you should habe a look at it.
  * [Thinking about SVG-preloaders][3]  
    Oh that&#8217;s awesome, the future is here.
  * [Google Chrome 35 beta adds much needed DirectWrite font rendering on Windows][4]  
    This is nice. Finally.
  * [IE Developer Channel][5]  
    Microsoft starts offering a Developer Beta of it&#8217;s newest IE. That&#8217;s great news.
  * [GitHub Octicon][6]  
    GitHub open-sourced it&#8217;s own icon font. Maybe something for your next project?
  * [Async Attribute and Scripts At The Bottom][7]  
    Chris Coyier answers the question if there&#8217;s any reason to use the async attribute when the script is already at the bottom of the page.
  * [How I Prepare a New Talk][8]  
    Tim Kadlec goes through his steps preparing a talk, then giving it, until reviewing and improving on it.
  * [CSS Naming Conventions: Less Rules, more Fun][9]  
    Hans Christian Reinl explains his simple rules of straightforward CSS Naming Conventions. I fully agree.
  * [Blogging on CodePen][10]  
    The service gets better and better. Do I have to say more?
  * [Your Side Project Is Your Next Big Win w/ Tina Roth (aka swissmiss)][11]  
    Really great Chase Jarvis LIVE episode filled with tons of advice.
  * [Everything You Need to Know About the CSS will-change Property][12]  
    A must read post by Sara Soueidan.
  * [Interview with Jonnie Hallman][13]  
    Nice audio interview with Jonnie Hallman about his life as a freelancer. Some good advice in here.
  * [Free is a Lie][14]  
    Really interesting talk by Aral Balkan.
