It frequently happens that someone on Twitter asks me a question on some CSS/Front End topic. Sometimes it&#8217;s something general and other times it&#8217;s a specific problem. Most of the time I can make time to answer the question or help with the problem and it&#8217;s especially fun to tinker with a [jsfiddle][1] or [CodePen][2] and figuring out what&#8217;s wrong with a particular chunk of code.

I&#8217;m by no means omniscient but I always do my best to help. So [Jan][3] proposed that readers could ask questions right here on the blog and I think that&#8217;s a great idea. So from now on you can [ask me anything right here][4] on The Amazing Web and I try to help you as good as I can. I can&#8217;t guarantee that I can get back to every question or that I&#8217;ll have a good answer for every on but I&#8217;ll do my best. Promised.

I will post the answer here on the blog so everybody can benefit from the solution to a problem or just read my thoughts on a specific topic. You&#8217;ll find all of these in the new category [Reader Questions][5].
