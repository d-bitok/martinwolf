> Web development toolkit Bootstrap is getting ready to part ways with Twitter. The open source project began life at Twitter, but with its two primary developers leaving Twitter for other companies, Bootstrap will be spun off on its own.

I think it&#8217;s good to know that Bootstrap will stay alive and supported in the future.
