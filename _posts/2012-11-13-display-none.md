> When you’re putting content into your page, and then hiding it with CSS, it’s still there, it’s just not visible. So if you’re using this ‘technique’ across your site in numerous places, you’re likely taking a performance hit.

Laura has a point. If you&#8217;re using `display: none;` all over the place for responsive design purposes you should stop, think about what you&#8217;re doing and adjust accordingly.

She also makes a good point about writing about seemingly simple topics.
