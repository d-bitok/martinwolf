> On the same day as announcing that Opera has 300 million users, were also announcing that for all new products Opera will use WebKit as its rendering engine and V8 as its JavaScript engine. Its built using the open-source Chromium browser as one of its components. Of course, a browser is much more than just a renderer and a JS engine, so this is primarily an "under the hood" change.

Wow, this is big news and reminds of the [recent article][1] by Jeremy Kahn wishing for a webkit only web.
