> In OOCSS and Preprocessors in a Tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G, Nicole Sullivan explains how to write more modular CSS with SaSS.

While I&#8217;m not attending the first Smashing Conference Brad Frost is there and apparently takes a lot of notes and posts them on his blog. That&#8217;s super nice of him. This one is by Nicole Sullivan who talks about [OOCSS][1] and [SASS][2].
