> When we write about technology online, things can sound a bit black and white. Always do this, never do that.

> But blog posts and articles canâ€™t cover every scenario. The author knows nothing about your team, your site, your business goals, your deadlines, the behavior of the people who visit your site or the technology they use to visit with. There are characteristics of projects that may make a prescribed solution inappropriate.

Great advice not to blindly do as the others say.
