> October 2012 was quite a month in browser land. Microsoft shipped IE10 with Windows 8 last week. Google lost share for the second month in a row. Mozilla had to pull Firefox 16 due to a security hole, but recovered rather quickly. After all that, the latest market share numbers from Net Applications show that IE was the only big winner last month.

Nice round up by TheNextWeb. As a web developer it&#8217;s always good to keep an eye on the browser market share development but more importantly you should check your websites analytics stats and adjust accordingly. That&#8217;s why we at [QUOTE.fm][1] dropped IE8 support in spite it&#8217;s very popular in general.
