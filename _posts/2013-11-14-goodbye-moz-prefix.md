> Mozilla aims to advance the state of the open Web with new APIs. In the last few years, Mozilla has shipped experimental APIs with a "moz" prefix to indicate their lack of standardization e.g., mozRequestAnimationFrame. Unfortunately, this approach turned out to be harmful to the Web as experimental APIs ended up being used in some websites before the APIs were ready. In many cases, this meant that we were unable to innovate on certain APIs because to change them would break content on the Web. Therefore, to allow us to continue innovating without negatively affecting content on the Web, Mozilla will no longer ship new "moz"-prefixed APIs

Chrome, or let&#8217;s say Blink went this way and no Mozilla is following. That&#8217;s pretty good news!
