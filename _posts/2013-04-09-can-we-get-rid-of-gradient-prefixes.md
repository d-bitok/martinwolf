  Lea Verou shares her opinion on prefixing gradients:
</p>

> Don’t use -ms- prefixed gradients, there’s absolutely zero point in doing so. Include -moz- for the less subtle gradients. No significant need for -o- gradients. -webkit- is still needed and probably will be at least until the end of 2013. Or, of course, just use [-prefix-free][1] and don’t bother.
