> Even at the possible expense of wasted bandwidth and low definition — heck, even up-scaling — this introduces less complexity and concern than any “responsive/adaptive image” technique I’ve seen to-date. They’re all hacks. They all break things. Even the web standard proposals can’t decide which image would be appropriate to load. Too many edge cases.

Should we just skip the whole responsive images topic and just deliver one average and simple `img` element?
