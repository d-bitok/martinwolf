> The jQuery team is pleased to announced that jQuery 1.9.1 is available! This release addresses the bugs and regressions that have been reported during the past few weeks. Whether you’re using 1.9.0 or using an older version, these are the droids you’re looking for.

It&#8217;s just amazing to see how well jQuery is maintained.
