> Brad and Dave and I were sitting around after InControl talking about design patterns that hadn&#8217;t been explored as much. Dave mentioned "Search with Filters" as an example. There can be quite a lot of UI involved in a search filter, so you have the challenge of displaying that without taking up too much room for the actual results, as well as allowing the user to change those filters without being too disruptive.

Nice and simple solution for a responsive search with filters by Chris Coyier. Sure, this example is not applicable to all problems, but I like that Chris has invested time and did some exploration.

If you&#8217;re interested in more of those responsive design patterns. Have a look at [this list][1] by Brad Frost.
