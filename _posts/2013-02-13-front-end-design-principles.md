> We wanted to nail down the guiding principles behind our front-end work. All of us have a tacit shared understanding of where our priorities lie, but I thought it would be good to make it explicit.

Jeremy on defining front-end design principles. I think it&#8217;s a neccessary task to be able to deliver great products as a team.  
I will work in a new team very soon and I think it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how they work, what I have to adapt and what I can bring to the table.  
Also have a look at Jeremy&#8217;s other post on [coding style][1].
