> When you start using breakpoints, forget about setting breakpoints at standard size resolutions or displays. Set you break points where your design starts to actually ‘break’. Then do a little bit of work to rearrange and manipulate the elements to relate better and look better. In some cases, depending on your design, you may only need one or two breakpoints. In other cases you may need more, but follow the design and let the design dictate when it wants to respond or change to the view instead of forcing it to.

It should be obvious but it doesn&#8217;t seem to be to a lot of people.

Guys, resize your browser window, look at your design and decide when it&#8217;s time to rearrange the content, make fonts bigger, and so on. The device it is viewed on is totally irrelevant because we don&#8217;t know which screen sizes will be popular next or when we&#8217;ll see screens in refrigerators or something else we can&#8217;t imagine at the moment. But we need to make our website future proof. It&#8217;s a little bit of work but not impossible.
