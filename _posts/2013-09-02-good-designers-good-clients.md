> In the web community, it often seems like client work is what people do when they need money to fund the projects they really care about. I might be considered an oddball for not aspiring to work in a hip startup or create a product out of a side project. Client work has a reputation for being stressful, with clients being difficult and demanding. But for me, client work is helping people realize their meaningful projects. It doesn’t have to be enormously stressful—and it’s incredibly worthwhile.

Laura has a very good article on A List Apart in which she explains why she loves client work and what you can do to get better at and more excited by it.
