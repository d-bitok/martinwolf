It&#8217;s sunday afternoon and I was just fiddling around with some simple CSS transitions on links. This is the result. Make sure to click on a link to see the `:active` state. I don&#8217;t know how it behaves with a mouse, but with my trackpad the animation is different depending on how long you press down the trackpad. Kinda nice.
