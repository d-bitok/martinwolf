Hello and welcome to another Weekly Recap full of awesome and readworthy articles about CSS, performance, code editors and more. I hope you enjoy the list as much as I did reading all the articles. Have a nice day and coming week!

<!--more-->

  * [Medium’s CSS is actually pretty f\***ing good.][1]  
    Very interesting article about the CSS evolution at Medium. ([via][2])
  * [Why do (all) code editors look the same?][3]  
    An interesting approach for a new code editor.
  * [Pitch &#8211; Web Design][4]  
    Hilarious.
  * [The feature guy][5]  
    The one and only Jonathan Snook.
  * [Staying sane with small incremental releases][6]  
    A lesson to be learned.
  * [Constraints are Hard][7]  
    It&#8217;s more about Design, but I think the thinking works for Coding, too.
  * [Building markdown-based developer docs][8]  
    How Sauce Lab rebuilt their documentation.
  * [What do you do when your design pattern breaks down?][9]  
    There are a lot of ways to react. I could showcase my approach in a separate post if you like.
  * [Living with Web Apps][10]  
    Paul Kinlan tried to stay away from native apps for one day. Read how it turned out.
  * [CSS “position: sticky” – Introduction and Polyfills][11]  
    I love this new value for the position property.
  * [perf.fail &#8211; do, learn, fail forward.][12]  
    Awesome new blog all about web performance.
  * [A slice of heaven][13]  
    Chris Burnell explores what&#8217;s possible with CSS3.
  * [A Single Div][14]  
    And in a similar fashion this site is about what&#8217;s possible with a single div. Awesome things!
