Eric and Kat Meyer [lost][1] their 6 year old daughter Rebecca to cancer last Saturday. I&#8217;m so sorry for their loss. And like me, many others felt the same. The color purple or in hexcode #663399 was Rebeccas favourite color and the past week, in solicitousness and after a call by [Jeffrey Zeldman][2], we all colored our twitter avatars purple and made #663399becca trending on twitter. Almost my whole timeline went purple and it made me somehow proud of our community. We stay together and we are there for one another, even if we don&#8217;t know each other personally. I wish all the best to Eric and his family.

  * [5 reasons HTML5 ads are ready for prime time][3]  
    Not that I want ads on every site, but I know that they are here to stay, and I myself have one on this site, too. But I&#8217;d love to see them using web technologies other than Flash. It&#8217;s for the better for everyone.
  * [Light Sublime Themes][4]  
    There are tons of dark syntax highlighting themes for every editor, but not so many light ones. Here are some nice ones for Sublime Text.
  * [FirefoxNightly adds `srcset` support][5]  
    And here is a `srcset` attribute on `img` demo.
  * [Critical Path CSS Generator][6]  
    This is pretty cool, even though it didn&#8217;t work perfectly for me. Don&#8217;t know what the Critical Path is, check out the link.
  * [Comparing two ways to load non-critical CSS][7]  
    How to load CSS asynchronously.
  * [Sharing Data Between Sass and JavaScript with JSON][8]  
    Nice solution to a common problem.
  * [Work is the Magic Bullet][9]  
    He is just right.
  * [Firefox 30 for developers][10]  
    Finally they fixed the line-height for single-line text inputs.
  * [There are more mobile-optimized sites than ever. So why are mobile pages getting bigger?][11]  
    This is a good reminder to review what you&#8217;re doing.
