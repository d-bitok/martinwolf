> At GitHub, we use the command line every day. From git commands to script/server, we love the power it offers. This got us thinking, "why can&#8217;t we do that with github.com?"

And then they build it. GitHub yesterday introduced the Command Bar. I&#8217;ve played around with it a little bit and it&#8217;s really cool and helpful. It&#8217;ll be great for everybody who loves using just an input field for commands and navigation. Just like I love the Command Palette/Goto Palette of Sublime Text 2 or Alfred App.
