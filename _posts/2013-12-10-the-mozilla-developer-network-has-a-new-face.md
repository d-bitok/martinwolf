> Last summer the Mozilla Developer Network MDN underwent a massive platform change, moving from a hosted third-party solution to our own custom Django application code-named Kuma. That move laid the ground work for our latest major MDN upgrade: a complete front-end redesign, included many new features as well as usability and accessibility enhancements.

The awesome MDN has a completely new design and it looks really good. Even with [webplatform.org][1] around I still go to the MDN if I need to look something up.
