> Remote preview is a tiny JavaScript based tool which I built for our test lab. It allows you to preview any URL on large number of mobile devices simultaneously. Just enter a URL, hit enter, and new URL gets automatically loaded on each device. Remote preview works on platforms like Android, Blackberry, iOS, Maemo, Meego, Symbian, Windows Phone and WebOS.

Since I don&#8217;t have any sort of device lab I&#8217;ll probably don&#8217;t need it. But it surely sounds and [looks][1] great.
