Over the christmas holidays I did a redesign of [Stilpirat.de][1], a blog about photography by my good friend Steffen BÃ¶ttcher.

The design is a collaboration and surely not the fanciest thing in the world, but it&#8217;s solid, I think. We wanted to simplify the whole blog and in my opinion we reached this goal.

The site is responsive and retina ready thanks to an icon font by [weloveiconfonts.com][2]. It was my first time working with an icon font and this service and I think it&#8217;s a really great approach as long as you can get away with simple, one colored icons.

Are you working with icon fonts? If so, encountered any problems?
