CSSDeck just launched a new feature which records everything while you&#8217;re creating something on CSSDeck so you can publish it as a Codecast. This means everybody can not only see the finished code but also how you get there. It&#8217;s really cool and a great learning experience. I think i&#8217;ll try it in the future as a way of making a screencast for you guys.
