Google just announced that they&#8217;re going to shut down Google Reader on July 1, 2013. That&#8217;s bad news for a whole lot of people including me. My first thought was of Reeder App which solely relies on Google Reader and is used by so many, but Silvio already [said][1] we don&#8217;t have to worry.

I for one will hold still for a while and see what Silvio is doing with Reeder and switch to the according service, I think.

How long until Google shuts down Feedburner?
