> The third release candidate for WordPress 3.5 is now available. We’ve made a number of changes over the last week since RC2 that we can’t wait to get into your hands. Hope you’re ready to do some testing!

I just installed the RC3 on my local WordPress Testsite and it works just fine as far a I can see. I&#8217;m really looking forward to using the new media uploader/manager in my live sites.
