> As we saw a few weeks ago, the weight of an average web page is now almost 1.5MB (median ~1MB), with > 50% of this being images. Itâ€™s a harsh reminder that many of our pages on the web are still quite fat, a big concern for slower mobile data connections.

Thanks to Addy for sharing a big selection of tools to optimize your images.
