> I believe that by redefining time off, by creating space and time off throughout your daily life, the need to run away from your business for a week at a time may become less pressing. By accepting that you may need to do a minimum amount of work each day, you save the stress of wondering what might be waiting for you on your return. In doing so, you also bring a spirit of freedom and flexibility into your everyday life, rather than reserving it for two weeks a year.
