  Marco Arment:
</p>

> Users need to be less trusting of specific products, services, and companies having too much power over their technical lives, jobs, and workflows.In this business, expect turbulence. And this is going to be increasingly problematic as no turbulence pun intended we move so much more to “the cloud”, which usually means services controlled by others, designed to use limited or no local storage of your data.Always have one foot out the door. Be ready to go.

Well said. Marco Arment on free services, Google and you.
