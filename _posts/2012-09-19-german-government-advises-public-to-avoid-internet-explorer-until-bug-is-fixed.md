> Microsoft said yesterday that hackers can take advantage of the bug by luring Internet Explorer users to websites where theyâ€™ve planted malicious software. Once an unsuspecting user visits one of the sites, hackers can infect and take control of his PC, Microsoft said.

If you&#8217;re in the unfortunate situation that you&#8217;ve to use IE, it&#8217;s recommended that you install and configure the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit until the bug is fixed. You can get the EMET [here][1].
