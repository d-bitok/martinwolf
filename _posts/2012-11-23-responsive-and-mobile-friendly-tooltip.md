> When working on my personal website, I was in need of a tooltip. I decided not to limit it just on a typical definition of a tooltip, but also make it a better occurrence using CSS and jQuery technologies.

On [QUOTE.fm][1] we use tooltips here and there and from time to time they were a pain in the ass when it came to their responsive behavior. I always found relatively simple solutions for the specific problems, but an overall universal solution would be much better.

Today I once again had problems with tooltips. Luckily I found this article which solves all my problems. A simple tooltip, that is responsive and needs less markup than my current solutions. Amazing!

I definitely recommend using this approach next time you need to build a tooltip somewhere.
