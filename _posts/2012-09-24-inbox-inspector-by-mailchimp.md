> Use Inbox Inspector to make sure your email design looks great in all the major email clients. There are approximately a trillion different clients out there, so we do the work for you by automatically selecting the 10 mostâ€‘used clients in your subscriber list.

Another great tool for making sure your HTML e-mails look good in the inboxes of your customers is the Inbox Inspector of MailChimp. MailChimp sends a test mail to the ten most-used clients of your customers and shows you a list of all the screenshots. This makes testing so much easier. I remember the days when I sent dozens of mails to different adresses just to test in the installed e-mail clients. Boy, that wasn&#8217;t fun.

And because we&#8217;re already MailChimp customers with QUOTE.fm the service is free. Awesome!
