> We heard you, and it’s here! Now you can change between the “Left”, “Top”, and “Right” editor styles with new switcher buttons on the bottom left of the editor screen

The guys at CodePen are on fire! Another new great feature for all users: Choose your favourite editor layout.  
The feature was actually online since a few days, but was finally released officially today.
