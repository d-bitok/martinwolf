As a Web Developer you sometimes just need a bit of dummy HTML just for testing purposes. For example if you&#8217;re crafting a theme for a CMS you want to make sure that not only paragraphs and headlines look good but also lists, tables, etc. Sure, you can type all this by yourself but there is also a simpler solution: [html-ipsum.com][1]
