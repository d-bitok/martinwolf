Jamie put a lot of work into this, big thank you for that. Image optimisation is a big and important topic because it can save you a lot of unnecessary data that needs to be transferred. While this is great I rather send a few bytes more over the line than sacrificing image quality. But as always: It depends. You need to look at the results and shouldn&#8217;t be blindly compressing all of your images the same way.
