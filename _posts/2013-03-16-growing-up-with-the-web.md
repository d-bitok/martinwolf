> So, it doesn’t matter who you are — industry veteran, a kid just out of college, a guy from Boston looking for a career change, or a weekend hobbyist — if you have any interest in this industry, push the boundaries of your skill set — don’t let the amazing skills you have stagnate. Learn something new. Build something exciting. And please, share it with the rest of us! It’ll be awesome, and it will be totally worth it.

Yep.
