Today my dear friends this blog turns one year old. Time flies fast.

Over the last twelve months I linked to 411 stories, wrote 81 articles (of which a lot are just videos of other people), conducted 3 interviews, made 3 screencasts and posted 5 code snippets.

I think that&#8217;s not bad, but I&#8217;d like to shift to more original content. Or let&#8217;s say I want to keep the links and do more original content as well. Let&#8217;s see if I can do this.

For now I want to say thank you to all of you who read this blog. I hope you get something out of it.

If you want to read about something specific or just have an idea regarding TheAmazingWeb, let me know at martin@theamazingweb.net.

Thank you! <3
