> If you Google around on whether or not you should use lists as the markup for navigation on websites, you&#8217;ll find no debate. Every article suggest that yes you should. The vast majority of tutorials you read will use lists for navigation. The vast majority of templates you see will use lists for navigation. But is this ubiquitous markup pattern absolutely correct? Let&#8217;s see.

Should navigations marked up as a list? This is the question Chris tries to answer in this post. As it turns out in the [follow up][1] post, there is not a clearly right answer. I think I go ahead and keep styling my navigations as lists until it&#8217;s proven that it&#8217;s better not to.
