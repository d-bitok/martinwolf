> Facebook has begun using a Google image format called WebP that could lower its network costs and speed up its Web site. But the move has angered some members.

> When people upload JPEG photos, the social-networking juggernaut converts them into the WebP format. And now it also apparently has begun delivering those images to people with browsers that can handle them, which today means Chrome and Opera.

That&#8217;s interesting and I think a step in the right direction because the webp format is often much smaller than it&#8217;s jpg or png counterparts and thus should be the way to go in the future. But I never thought about the &#8220;problem&#8221; that users might save these images to their hard drives and aren&#8217;t able to do anything with them. ([via][1])
