> ResponsiveComments was designed to bring simple conditional loading to the client side. Although not the complete answer to conditional loading in responsive web design, ResponsiveComments provides a solution to simple conditional loading, directly within your markup, using HTML comments, media queries and feature detection.

This is a really nice idea and the implementation is rather simple. Although it needs a bunch of Javascript to function well in all modern browsers + IE9, it might come in handy from time to time. Make sure to have a look at it.
