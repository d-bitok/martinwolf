> IE 10 for Windows 8 has been out for months and there’s a preview version available for Windows 7, but so far Microsoft has not officially released an IE upgrade for Windows 7 users.
> 
> That’s likely to change in the very near future given that the company has released an IE 10 Automatic Update Blocker Toolkit for businesses and organizations that don’t want to upgrade to IE 10. Naturally the only reason you’d need to block IE 10 is if it is in fact finally coming to Windows 7.

Good news everyone!
