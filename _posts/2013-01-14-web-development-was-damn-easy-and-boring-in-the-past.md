**Recently I thought about how I got started with web development and in retrospect it was all very easy.**

All I had to worry about was that my sites looked good in all major browsers. Okay, IE6 was still a thing then and it was a pain in the ass, but aside from that, there was not a whole lot to worry about. We all thought pixel based layouts with a maximum width of 960px were the Holy Grail and retina was not even a word. Or at least I had never heard of it. File sizes were still a concern, but not as much as they were in the early days of the web and so basically it was damn easy to build websites.

Over the past one or two years there was a rapid development and a good, modern Front End Developer needs to pay attention to a lot of things. We have retina screens which demand higher resolution graphics and at the same time bandwith is a big concern again because of this huge boost in mobile device surfing. The latter is also one reason for building fluid, responsive websites, which we should have done from the beginning, but that&#8217;s another topic. Mobile devices also bring a whole lot of new browsers to the market in which we need to test. And this won&#8217;t stop soon. Think about [all those devices][1] which will get internet connections.

And besides all these general things our tools develop rapidly, too. We now work with [SASS][2], [CoffeeScript][3], automatically generate sprites with [Compass][4], use icon fonts and think about [object oriented CSS][5] and all that stuff. And don&#8217;t forget that [Flexbox][6] is just around the corner.

Okay, enough. I don&#8217;t want to say that this is all bad. I love it. The developments in all areas are great and one reason why I love making websites is because everything is always evolving and you&#8217;re never done learning. It keeps it interesting and fresh.  
But I think of all the people who are starting out now. All the topics could be a bit overwhelming at first and I wonder how they deal with it and what we can do to make their first experiences of building websites better.
