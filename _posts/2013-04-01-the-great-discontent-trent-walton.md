> I really think that it would be Paravel—just the idea that you can find some friends, commit to each other, and stick it out. That’s really why I enjoy what I do. We’ve been really lucky, but no achievement we’ve had has outweighed how much I value working with those two guys and the trust and commitment that we have with one another. It’s been hard and it’s not something I would universally recommend to everyone, but finding some friends who you can trust and build something with has been my favorite part of all of this. Nothing I’ve done would have been possible without them.
