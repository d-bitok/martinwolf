> Guys! This is the beginning of a new (as if there has ever been one on here) series: How to not suck at Photoshop. It’ll be a mix of tips, tricks and small things I discovered throughout the years. Nothing too fancy, just in case somebody hasn’t heard of these things, yet.

I know, this is a development centric blog but even we as developers have to use Photoshop from time to time and I actually like it. So keep an eye out on this series by my friend Marcel and you might learn a thing or two.

And hey, I&#8217;m back from vacation!
