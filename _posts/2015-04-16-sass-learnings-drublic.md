Hans Christian Reinl:

> There are a couple of great articles on how to use Sass in large scale projects — this one is more of a retrospective. I hope it helps you solving problems if you ever run into them.

Hans shares his learnings from working on two large scale projects in which he and his team ran into different problems with Sass. Love those kind of posts.
