> Over the course of the past few months, I’ve been working on a redesign of caniuse.com together with Alexis Deveria aka @Fyrd, author of the site. If you don’t know caniuse.com yet, it’s an essential resource with compatibility tables for support of HTML5, CSS3, SVG and more in desktop and mobile browsers.

The widely popular and much appreciated site [caniuse.com][1] is undergoing a redesign and the creators want to hear what you think of it thus far. I think the [prototype][2] already looks and feels great.
