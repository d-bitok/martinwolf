While clicking through some of the talk slides from Chris Coyier in one of his [latest blog posts][1], I discovered a [CodePen.io][2] [screenshot][3] featuring the announcement of Pro features. Chris talked a little bit about this on a podcast lately, but didn&#8217;t say too much.  
So this is the list I can extract from the screenshot. Maybe it&#8217;s the real deal?

  * Live View: Test across multiple devices
  * Teach a room live with Proffessor view
  * Pair program with people in real time
  * Optionally keep your Pens private

Although I&#8217;ve no idea what a Pro account will cost, I think I&#8217;ll get one.
