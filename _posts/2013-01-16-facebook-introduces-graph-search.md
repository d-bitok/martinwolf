Yesterday Facebook introduced Graph Search, a search engine that lets you search for things like &#8220;my friends who like cycling&#8221; or &#8220;photos my friends took in New York City&#8221;. I think it&#8217;s great so far as I can judge it. The feature is first available in the US so I have to wait to actually get my fingers on it.

You can learn more about the Graph Search on [Facebook][1].
