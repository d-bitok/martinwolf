**Today [Philipp][1], [Marcel][2] and I opened up [watched.li][3] to the public.**

<img src="http://theamazingweb.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/watchedli.jpg" alt="" title="watchedli" width="540" height="587" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-537" /> 

Watched.li is our newest project on which we worked on the side and therefore it&#8217;s still very basic:

> Ever forgot which episodes you&#8217;ve already watched? We let you keep track of the TV shows you enjoy.

The site isn&#8217;t fully responsive at the moment but the most used page, the overview of the shows you&#8217;re tracking, is optimized for all screen sizes so you can tick off episodes while sitting on the couch and watching your favorite show.

We&#8217;ll keep working on watched.li to make it even better step by step. We plan to add things like statistics, public profiles and more. So stay tuned and follow [@watchedli][4] on Twitter.

If you find a bug or have a cool idea, please let us know. Thank you! <3
