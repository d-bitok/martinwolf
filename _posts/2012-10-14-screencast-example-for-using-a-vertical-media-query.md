**Hey guys, I just recorded my first english speaking screencast. Normally I&#8217;m just writing and reading english so that was really odd for me and I was a little bit nervous. So forgive me for mumbling all the time. I promise improvement.**

But I have to say that I like the screencast format very much and I have to get better at speaking english anyway. So bear with me here, please. :D

I did the recording with QuickTime so the quality is not as good as I would love it to be. If I do this more often I&#8217;ll purchase a dedicated screencasting app.
