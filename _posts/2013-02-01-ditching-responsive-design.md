> We were pitching to the wrong audience &#8211; it turns out that not many people shop around for Direct Debit on their mobiles. When we analysed our traffic, we found that only 2% of visits were from mobile devices.

GoCardless ditched responsive design for their newest site and explain why. I get the point, but can&#8217;t agree completely. Sure, they&#8217;ll come away with it but I think it still would be better if they took a greater effort and made a new design which is great for all screen sizes and not just go the relatively easy way and switch back to a 980px fixed width page.  
In my opinion responsive design isn&#8217;t just a trend. It is here to stay and not only mobile device users benefit from it. Imagine you have a 27&#8243; screen but only use your browser in a small window.
