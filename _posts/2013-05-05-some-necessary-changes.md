> I’m sure you have already guessed where I’m going with this: I’m dropping links from this blog. It was fun for a while, but ultimately too demanding and it started to suck the value out of other areas. This is a change for the better for readers and a change for the better for members.

I know how Jordan feels and I&#8217;ve thought about dropping linked list posts in favor of more original content, too, but I&#8217;ll read other stuff and will at least tweet about them anyway. So why not keep posting the links on the blog, I think.
