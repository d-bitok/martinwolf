**HTML5 breaking new ground for online casino games**

The online casino gaming industry has, in a lot of ways, benefited from the advent of HTML5. It let developers create sharper, more fluid graphics and introduced innovations that should prove essential in future improvements. Its ability to work across a multitude of different platforms alone has made it an essential ingredient in online gaming operators’ recipe for success.

In fact, even the first online casino in 1996 that’s still in operation today, [InterCasino][1], has benefited well from the more modern HTML5. Most of its games are now non-native and written using HTML5 in order to give gamers 3D-rendered video slots and table games.  
   
But despite the clear benefits, HTML5 has proved to be quite polarizing in the app development landscape. It figured in a debate during last year’s [mGaming Summit][2] where developers and operators pitted HTML5 apps against native ones. Supporters extolled its cross-functionality; detractors contended that customers prefer native apps.  
   
The debate has become increasingly important as more and more online gaming operators start to see mobile as the next big gaming landscape. Speaking to [Trusted Reviews][3] in London, poker technology expert Jeffrey Haas had predicted that portable gamers would make up a large chunk of the gaming giant’s client base within a year.  
   
“Today we have 4 percent of our user base (on mobile), but I see it growing,” said Haas. “I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s 25 to 30 per cent of all players by the end of 2014, if not more.”  
   
While the HTML5 vs native app debate is far from settled, there has been some innovative and very interesting work done in HTML5 that should help propel the online gaming market even further. One great example is [Bitflop][4], a heads-up online poker game that leverages HTML5’s WebRTC technology to add a more human element to typically anonymous online poker matches.  
   
“Bitflop is a new way to play heads-up poker using your webcam,” Bitflop’s developer Chris Zieba explains. “All that is required is a modern browser and a webcam. Bitflop uses the latest HTML5 WebRTC technology to deliver peer-to-peer, encrypted, high definition audio/video in the web browser. No third-party app downloads or browser-plugins required!” The game is currently in alpha. Zieba promises to release the source code on [Github][5] once it reaches beta.

While the more hardcore online poker players would probably prefer to keep playing up to 3,000 hands an hour by multitabing, BitFlop does pose an intriguing possibility for casual players and even tournament organizers. Professional poker players have turned the ability to read verbal and physical tells into an art form when playing in live settings, so a program that would afford online players a similar education could prove to be groundbreaking.
