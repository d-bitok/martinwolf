I think this is a brilliant idea by Harry Roberts (and Chris Coyier as well as Dave Rupert): Having a `shame.css` for all your nasty hacks so that everybody on the team is aware of them. The problem I see is, will there ever be time to go back and fix those hacks? In a perfect world this would be the case, but in reality I doubt it. Nevertheless, I might be implementing this idea into the `watched.li` codebase just to give it a go in a relatively small project.
