> Important: The Google Feedburner APIs have been officially deprecated as of May 26, 2011 will be shut down on October 20, 2012.

The trusted Feedburner will be gone pretty soon, so I changed the RSS Feed url for this blog back to my self hosted one. It&#8217;s no big deal since The Amazing Web is fairly new. All of you who subscribed to the RSS feed please change it to the new one: [theamazingweb.net/feed][1]

If anyone knows a good WordPress plugin to track subscribers, etc please let me know.
