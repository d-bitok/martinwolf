**Hey! Over the last few weeks I got more and more discontent with the current design. So yesterday I had an idea and I just started coding away.**

The new design is very simple, but not boring. Or at least I think so. Hope you like it, too. You can have a look at the code at [GitHub][1]. But it&#8217;s really nothing fancy. What might be interesting is, that I didn&#8217;t use one single media query.

If you&#8217;re interested, the favicons are served by [getFavicon][2] and the social media icons are done by [Paul Robert Lloyd][3].

Ah, and try hitting `ctrl + f` while being on the site (Update: Sorry, currently only working on Mac). I wanted to have this feature for myself for a long time and now I implemented it. Hope you&#8217;ve use for it, too. Especially when the snippet archive grows bigger.

Feedback is welcome. Just @reply me on [Twitter][4] or send me an [e-mail][5]. Thanks!

Cheers,  
Martin
