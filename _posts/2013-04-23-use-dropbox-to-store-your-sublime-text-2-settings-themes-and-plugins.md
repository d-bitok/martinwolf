> Sometimes you work on Windows, sometimes on Mac or Linux or just on another computer but you still want to use the settings, themes and set of plugins everywhere.  One of the easiest ways to do this is to use your DropBox account.

If you are, like me currently, working on two different machines and using Sublime Text 2 as your code editor, this is a nice little tutorial that will make your life better. It explains how you can sync all you settings, themes and plugins with Dropbox, using symlinks. In addition to that I store all of my files and Sublime Text Projects in my Dropbox. One could say I live and work in the cloud. Woohoooo!
