Chris explains why he uses and loves WordPress. I can totally agree with him. I&#8217;ve thought about moving away from WordPress because a lot of people were crazy about some new CMS but I always came back to the conclusion that WordPress is best suited for me and the sites I&#8217;m building. Highfive!
