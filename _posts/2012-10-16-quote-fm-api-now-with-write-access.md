> Our API with write access is out now. Please read this [getting started guide][1] to get comfortable with our authentication method.

Hey fellow developers, today we released the second part of the [QUOTE.fm API][2], it&#8217;s all about the write access for your apps. So you&#8217;re finally able to send recommendations to QUOTE.fm from your own app or save articles for later reading.

We&#8217;re really excited and curious what you will build with the new API possibilities. [Reeder][3], the popular RSS Reader for iPhone, iPad and Mac already enables it&#8217;s users to recommend articles from it&#8217;s iPhone and Mac app. The latter one even lets you save articles for later reading.
