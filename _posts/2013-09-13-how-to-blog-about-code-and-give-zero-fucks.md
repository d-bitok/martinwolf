> But there are a lot more not-Marissa-Mayers in the world than there are Marissa Mayers and those people need representation, lest we get it into our obsessive little developer heads that if you are not constantly being the very best at everything you should just go home. We need blog posts that aren’t about big fluffy TED topics like programmer diversity and are instead about that fucking stubborn and reprehensible bug you spent five hours on today because you couldn’t find a goddamned thing on StackOverflow.

I&#8217;m guilty of blogging too much links and too little own content which could help some of you or would just document my progress of growing as a developer, too. I want to change that and post more little stuff I find out about or try out without the need to be 100% perfect. And I want to encourage you to do the same.
