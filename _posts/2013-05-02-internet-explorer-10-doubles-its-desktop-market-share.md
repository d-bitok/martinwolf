> Microsoftâ€™s Internet Explorer 10 saw a meteoric rise in market share last month, jumping from 2.93 percent in March to 6.22 percent in April, according to NetMarketShare.

This means IE10 and IE6 have approximately the same market share. While this might sound depressing, it&#8217;s nice to see IE10 gain some traction.
