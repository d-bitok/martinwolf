> In our fifth issue we speak to Mac-app and iOS-game designer Neven Mrgan, entrepreneur and body-hacker Ryan Carson, mobile photography enthusiast Jessica Zollman, icon design maestro Jon Hicks, the CEO of dorm-room startup Squarespace, Anthony Casalena, and Malaysian-American web designer and avid cyclist Naz Hamid.

Issue 5 of the awesome Offscreen Magazine is ready for Pre-Order. After buying the first four issues one by one I finally switched to a subscription. I encourage you to do the same. It&#8217;s worth the money.
