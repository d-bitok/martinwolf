> But instead of providing visual feedback in the final stages of development, our designers will modify the actual CSS themselves. They will be responsible for tweaking and polishing the final product until they feel itâ€™s perfect in Chrome. From there, the developers will still be responsible for ensuring cross-browser consistency.

The topic of designing in the browser and the question whether a designer should be able to write code or not is coming up over and over again. I think it&#8217;s very true that Designers and Front End Developers need to work together very very closely and I think it&#8217;s of great benefit if there are pairs of Designers and Developers so that they know how the other one thinks and works. This is in my opinion the right way to produce incredibly beautiful designs and also having it translated into modern, cross-browser compatible, responsive websites.

I really don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the right way trying to educate all the designers to let them write their own code.

It all comes down to communication. As always in life so much problems can be solved or avoided in the first place if people talk with each other.

We at [QUOTE.fm][1] talk a lot. Designer with Front End Developer and Front End Developer with Back End Engineer. And it works really great. And not only because we can trust each other, but because everyone is a specialist in his own field but also knows the basics of the other ones. There is no need for [Marcel][2] writing CSS, me writing PHP or [Philipp][3] designing in Photoshop.
