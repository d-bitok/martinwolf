**Hey, I build a fun, simple one-pager with AngularJS and the dribbble API. It&#8217;s called [GiveMeSomethingToCode][1].**

Have some spare time and just want to code something and don&#8217;t know what? Then [GiveMeSomethingToCode][1] is for you. It displays random [dribbble][2] shots that you could code. It suggests to create a Pen on [CodePen][3] so you can start right away and easily share your code.

I always thought there should be a connection of some kind between dribbble and CodePen. Maybe this is a start in this direction.

Happy coding!

(You can find the code on [GitHub][4] if you want to have a look or fork it.)
