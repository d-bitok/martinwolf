> The real reasons for this tool is to educate and to facilitate a mental shift. Many clients, designers and developers get hung up on specific device widths, which is why this tool doesnâ€™t include any such language, device chrome or anything like that. Ish. helps keep everyone focused on making a design that looks and functions great at any resolution.

I don&#8217;t need a viewport resizer for my development workflow but it&#8217;s a nice tool to play around with. I love that he completely abstained from using any device related terms.
