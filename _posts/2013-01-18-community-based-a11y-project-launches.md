  Dave Rupert:
</p>

> The web is a unique medium and Universal Access is one of its core features. A non-sighted person has never picked up a book or magazine off the rack at an airport or seen a billboard on the highway, but they use the internet every day. On the internet we&#8217;re all equal and that is the beauty of the hypertext world we live in and are creating.

Dave Rupert talks with .net magazine about his newest project &#8220;The Accessibility Project, short: A11Y.

It&#8217;s a great project to which I&#8217;ll pay attention in the future because accessibility is sadly a topic I&#8217;m not too familiar with, yet.
