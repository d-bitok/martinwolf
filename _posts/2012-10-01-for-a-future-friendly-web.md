</p>

> As the digital landscape continues to become even more complex, it&#8217;s essential for us to start thinking beyond the desktop and embrace the unpredictability of the future. There&#8217;s no such thing as future-proof, but there are things we can do in order to better prepare ourselves for the era of ubiquitous connectivity. We need to start thinking and acting differently in order to create meaningful web experiences that continue to be relevant well beyond the scope of the initial projects.

Cool, Brad Frost put up his slides of his talk &#8220;For a future-friendly web&#8221;. Would have loved to see it live, but the slides are better than nothing.
