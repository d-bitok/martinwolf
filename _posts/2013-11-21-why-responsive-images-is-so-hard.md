> It makes sense that there is disagreement, because it is hard to back up a guess with data. A lot of people are just shooting from the hip. Mix in egos and politics and its amazing it has even gotten this far. I&#8217;m rather astounded we have web standards at all (knock on wood).

Chris sums up the current situation regarding responsive images and who is involved in finding a solution and what either group wants and needs. This is one of the most important problems we face at the moment and I don&#8217;t see a solution coming up anytime soon.
