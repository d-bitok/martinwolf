> Flexbox is pretty awesome and is certainly part of the future of layout. The syntax has changed quite a bit over the past few years, hence the "Old" and "New" syntax. But if we weave together the old, new, and in-between syntaxes, we can get decent browser support.

Wanna use Flexbox and still support a big chunk of browsers? Here you go, Chris wrote a great post about using the old and new syntaxes together. Thanks!
