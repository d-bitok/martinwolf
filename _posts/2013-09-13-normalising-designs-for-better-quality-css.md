The slides of Harry Roberts talk from earlier today at CSSConf.eu in Berlin are already up for your viewing pleasure.

I think he makes a great point but always keep in mind to talk with your designers and don&#8217;t just change the design if you think it&#8217;s too hard to build. Often you might be right but a good designer might have done something the way it is because of a very specific reason. I think you should normalise and rationalise the heck out of everything like Harry says, but don&#8217;t ignore your designers and art directors. (But I&#8217;m sure Harry never wanted you to do that anyway.)
