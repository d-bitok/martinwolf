Why on earth is there nothing like that?

<pre class="lang-css"><code class="lang-css">list-style-type: dash;</code></pre>

It&#8217;s really nothing special and I would say it&#8217;s some kind of standard for displaying an unordered list but we still have to use `:before` to inject dashes. There must be a reason for that. Any ideas?
