> When creating web pages, the only part of it that you can rely upon working is the HTML (and even that can fail, but without it there is no web page and everything else becomes moot). The attitude towards building for the web with this in mind is called progressive enhancement. Briefly, each extra layer (images, styling, behaviour, video, audio) of the page should be seen as optional. If you build pages with the idea that anything other than HTML that you add is optional, you will create a better and more robust web page.

In theory and in a perfect world this sounds great. But you know&#8230; that&#8217;s almost never the case in a real life project. ([via][1])
