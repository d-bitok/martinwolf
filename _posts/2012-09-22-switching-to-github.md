> Switching to Github was not only a change of the software we used but also a big change to our development process. Now we try to work with more strict. That means: branches for new features, pull requests and the master branch is always save to deploy. Sounds familiar? Well, we took this from Github. Maybe it seems a bit overkill currently — but we’re currently searching for new [iOS][1] and [PHP][2] developers!

Philipp, our CTO at [QUOTE.fm][3] wrote about our switch from self hosted SVN to GitHub. We just love it.
