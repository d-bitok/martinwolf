> I’ve learnt a great deal from SMACSS and I believe that writing good CSS is about finding that balance between writing clean, reusable HTML written independently of CSS and clean, reusable CSS making use of HTML element classnames. I feel like this book has made me understand a lot more about CSS and I really recommend it if you’re striving to be more efficient.

Nice review of a really good book about CSS: [SMACSS][1] by Jonathan Snook.
