This video by Scott Buscemi demonstrates and explains how the upcoming Safari 7 Native Push Notifications for Mac will work. If you already have the Mavericks beta and therefore Safari 7 you can go to [kandutech.net][1] and check it out yourself.  
The bad thing about these new notifications is that you need Safari to set them up. The good thing is that once you allowed a site to send to native push notifications Safari doesn&#8217;t need to be running and a click on the notifications will take you to the site in your default browser.
