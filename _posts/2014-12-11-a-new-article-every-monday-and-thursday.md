Hello,

I have an announcement to make.

I like writing this blog and sharing with you what I learn while I&#8217;m developing sites for clients. I&#8217;ve always thought that it&#8217;s a great way of giving back and contributing to the awesome developer community we have. While in the past I&#8217;m more or less randomly posted articles whenever I had time or just learned something new, I want to bring this into a more sorted order now and increase my effort to bring you awesome blog posts and help you become a better web developer.

**From now on I will post a new article every Monday and Thursday**.

In the days between I will continue to post links to great articles, videos, talks, etc that I come across while reading other blogs and browsing Twitter.  
I hope you like this change and you can learn a thing or two from the articles I write. Thank you for reading!

Happy Coding,  
Martin
