Paul Irish takes an in-depth look at the WebKit and answers the following questions:

> What is WebKit?  
> What isnâ€™t WebKit?  
> How is WebKit used by WebKit-based browsers?  
> Why are all WebKits not the same?

I learned a lot and if you can&#8217;t answer the questions above I recommend you take some time and read it too.
