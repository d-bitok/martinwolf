> Today Iâ€™m glad to announce that the complete Source Code family of six weights is ready for primetime and is available through the same channels as Source Sans. You can download the fonts and source files from the Open@Adobe portal on SourceForge. You can clone and fork the project on GitHub. You can also use the fonts on the web through Adobe Edge Web Fonts, Typekit, WebINK, and Google Web Fonts.

Source Code Pro is a new very good looking monospaced font by Adobe. I just defined it as my default font in Sublime Text 2. Let&#8217;s see how I think of it in a few days.
