</p>

> inuit.css aims to be more useful to a wider array of people than Bootstrap is; inuit.css is a design-free framework meaning it can be used on literally any type of project. You define your own font sizes, your own spacing units for paddings etc and you extend inuit.css with your own stylesheet to add skin. inuit.css makes no decisions or assumptions, because thatâ€™s not the job of a framework.

Harry Roberts has completely rewritten his CSS framework inuit.css. I&#8217;m really not the guy who uses frameworks but this looks really cool and I think just by analyzing it you can learn some things. Anyway, I&#8217;m rather write my own CSS from the ground up. Sorry, Harry. :D
