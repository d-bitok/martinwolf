Hello and welcome to this Weekly Recap. Today I&#8217;m on time again and that&#8217;s good news, isn&#8217;t it? So don&#8217;t let&#8217;s waste time and get right into it. Enjoy!

  * [Material Design Paper Elements Sampler][1]  
    Shwocasing the paper design elements of the new Google design language as Polymer components.
  * [Getting Your PageSpeed Score Up][2]  
    Nice, simple to understand video by Matt Gaunt from Google.
  * [Generate SVG with Photoshop CC][3]  
    Very easy way to export svg files right from Photoshop. I heard it&#8217;s buggy sometimes, but I haven&#8217;t had problems so far.
  * [Optimizing Images][4]  
    Just a quick, but important reminder by Trent Walton.
  * [Please don&#8217;t use externally hosted JavaScript libraries][5]  
    And here is why.
  * [Coming Home to Vim][6]  
    The article is actually from 2010, but still interesting to everyone who&#8217;s starting to use vim or thinking about it.
  * [3% of users browse with IE9 and 14% of users have a disability. Why do we only cater for the former?][7]  
    Even though the font is horrible to read, the content is good.
  * [A Guide for Young People: What to Do With Your Life][8]  
    Not really a development topic, but I think it&#8217;s great advice even for not so &#8220;young&#8221; people.
  * [Hey! I&#8217;m Jason Fried, Founder & CEO at Basecamp. AMA!][9]I&#8217;m sure there are interesting bits in it for everyone.
