> To me, not everything is doom and gloom, and the Web isnâ€™t losing. I am actually very excited about what we are doing on the Web, and I see a lot of great things happening right now. I look back at what I had to work with in the past and see how professional and rich our development environments are now, and I am very happy indeed.

Very good article about the future of the (open) Web.
