> So I am now offering you, wonderful reader, the opportunity to support my writing by becoming a member of jordanm.co.uk. The content will always remain free as it should, this is simply a way of offering your appreciation and encouraging me to keep writing. Oh and there are a couple of benefits:

Writing, curating and maintaining a blog, no matter how much fun it is, consumes a lot of time. And time is money, so they say. So I think it&#8217;s important that bloggers start to monetize what they do. Not everybody has to make a fortune or go full time with his site, but it&#8217;s nice to get some money out of it. Ads are an option as well as a Membership. I&#8217;m curious to see how it goes for Jordan. Go ahead and support him.
