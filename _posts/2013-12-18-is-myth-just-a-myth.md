  Chris Eppstein:

> As I researched, I realized that what I was looking at was not something that matched the description. I expected to find a CSS polyfill that implemented the new CSS specs. So I gave it some basic use cases and it didn&#8217;t just not handle them, it turned my code from something that would work in the next firefox, into code that was broken in every browser. I didn&#8217;t get a warning, I didn&#8217;t get an error. I just got broken output. Over the course of 30 minutes, I went from "WOW" to "WTF, this isn&#8217;t software most people should use yet".

So last night (at least if you are in Europe) Chris Eppstein, the creator of Sass, tested the new CSS processor [Myth][1] and came to the conclusion, that it doesn&#8217;t work as advertised and started talking about it on Twitter which lead to some sort of backlash. In the end he apologized for saying a few things the not so nice way, but I think we can all agree that Chris as well as the Segment.io guys, who build Myth, all just want the same: Help the web developer community and share their knowledge. And I&#8217;m glad that they do.

What Myth can and will do for us in the future remains to be seen.
