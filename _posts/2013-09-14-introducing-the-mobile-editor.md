> The editors are now tabbed, so you can tap your way back and forth between them. No more zooming in and out and getting awkwardly shifted around. And besides the layout, we serve fewer resources in general so it should load and cache better.

CodePen updated their editor view and made it mobile optimised. That&#8217;s very cool although I don&#8217;t think a lot of people will code big things in it. But it&#8217;s a nice addition and even looking and the code of others on your mobile gets a lot better.

I tried it for a few minutes and it behaves really well. The one thing that bothered me is that I don&#8217;t get a loupe when holding down text so that I can drag the cursor. This means I&#8217;m not really able to navigate my code. I hope this is just an issue with my iOS 7 Safari.
