This blog runs on WordPress, mostly because that&#8217;s what I know. Basically it works great, but from time to time it come across problems and that&#8217;s always the point when I think about alternative solutions. Lately I heard a lot about Jekyll and I&#8217;m tempted to give it a try. A fellow web craftsman, Hugo Giraudel moved his blog to Jekyll last month and blogged about it.

It&#8217;s an interesting read and he likes it. So much I can say.

I&#8217;m wondering if Jekyll is a good fit if one does a lot of link blogging like I do. What do you guys think?
