> Today you can download the new Twitter for iPad. Weâ€™ve rebuilt the app from the ground up to make it fast, beautiful and easy to use.

Twitter just released a new version of their [iPad App][1] and also updated the iPhone version. Especially the one for iPad is really well done for what I can say after the first few minutes playing around with it. Especially the new profiles look really good and they are updated on the website as well. [Look here][2].
