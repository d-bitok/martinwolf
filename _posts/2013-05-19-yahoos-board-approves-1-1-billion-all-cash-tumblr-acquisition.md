> According to The Wall Street Journal, Yahoo&#8217;s board of directors has approved the company&#8217;s widely-rumored acquisition of Tumblr in an all-cash deal worth $1.1 billion. 

Just in case you missed that somehow.  
I don&#8217;t really have an opinion on the acquisition. I&#8217;ve never really used tumblr much and don&#8217;t plan to do so in the future. But let&#8217;s see what Yahoo does with it.
