> We have a list as long as I am tall of things we want to add and improve on CodePen. Our big push right now is to get out "PRO" features. This is what is going to make CodePen into a business which is a priority right now. There are a good 8-10 features that we hope make this upgrade pretty compelling.

Nice interview with Chris Coyier about [CodePen.io][1]. Looking forward to the Pro accounts. I think I&#8217;ll probably purchase one even if I don&#8217;t need the Pro features too often, just because I want to support these guys. Great service!
