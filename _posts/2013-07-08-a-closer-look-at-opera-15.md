  Bruce Lawson:
</p>

> When we took the decision to switch to Chromium, compatibility was one reason — but most importantly, we wanted to spend our time on browser innovation, rather than competing on building a rendering engine. We had a deep look at Opera’s internal architecture and it soon became clear that Quick, the cross-platform UI framework we’d introduced back in 2003, was so entangled with Presto’s code that just swapping Presto with Chromium was far from a straightforward task.

Last week Opera 15 came out and Bruce Lawson write up a post on the vision behind it and what&#8217;s coming in the future.  
You can grab Opera 15 with Blink [here][1]. Your current Opera 12 won&#8217;t be auto updated, so you can keep that one if you like to.
