> Windows 8 ships with two (!) versions of Internet Explorer 10. One for the desktop experience and one for the Windows UI experience.
> 
> Both ship with a built in version of Flash BUT the Windows UI version won’t run Flash unless your site is on a whitelist. The Desktop version will run Flash as normal.
> 
> You can add a meta tag to your pages which will trigger a prompt to the user to run your site in the desktop IE if they visit it using the Windows UI version of IE (a lovely user experience… not)
> 
> Lastly they give details on how you get you site added to the whitelist (basically emailing Microsoft with the details of your site and details of how it conforms to Microsoft’s Flash Content Guidelines)
