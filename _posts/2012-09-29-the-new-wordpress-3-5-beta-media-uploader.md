**As I [mentioned][1], WordPress released Version 3.5 Beta 1 with a new Media Uploader. This update was needed badly. I installed the new beta to test it and it&#8217;s so much better. Finally you can insert more than one image at once into a post. Sad that I&#8217;ve to point that out as a great new feature, but it is.**

Apart from that everything is pretty smooth. You can choose between the new media interface or the old one to just quickly insert one image. The new button opens a popup in which you can just drag and drop your images.

The upload progress is shown with a nice progress bar and then you get a thumbnail overview of all the images. You can just select one and insert it into the post or select several at once and insert them all into your article. When you&#8217;ve selected more than one image you can also create a gallery with them and insert that into the post.

What&#8217;s missing in the new media uploader/management system at the moment are all the settings for an image like choosing which size should be insert in to the post or if it should be a link and so on. But I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll add all these options. It&#8217;s only the first beta. But I&#8217;m really looking forward to this update.
