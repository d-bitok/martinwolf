> One thing I do know is that making money is not the same as starting a business. For entrepreneurs, this is an important thing to understand. Most of us identify with the products we create or services we provide. I make software. He is a headhunter. She builds computer networks. But the fact is, all of us must master one skill that supersedes the others: making money. You can be the most creative software designer in the world. But if you don&#8217;t know how to make money, you&#8217;re never going to have much of a business or a whole lot of autonomy.

Jason Fried on making money. Great piece as always.
