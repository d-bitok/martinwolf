> Content-out design means defining your underpinning design structure from your content, and then focusing on what happens in between ‘layouts’. This approach of optimising your design by adding media queries I like to call these optimisation points than break points, because nothing is broken without them, just better, means you are always looking at your content as you’re working.

I like how Mark calls &#8216;break points&#8217; &#8216;optimisation points&#8221;.  
He is also right in every regard. It&#8217;s not the right solution to try making a desktop, a tablet and a mobile phone layout based on fixed widths.  
What I do is, I make my browsers window smaller, see what happens and act accordingly. This could mean, rearranging sections, bumping up the font size or anything else. This way the design is fluid and looks good on any device and size. But I still recommend having a look at your site on your devices and try tapping on stuff and things like that. You are much better at judging type size and whatnot if you look at the actual devices.
