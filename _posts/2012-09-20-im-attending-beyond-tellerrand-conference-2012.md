> Yay! We are back with another edition of beyond tellerrand, an affordable 3-day event with intensive workshops and 16 high-quality talks for web enthusiasts

I just bought my ticket for this years beyond tellerrand conference in DÃ¼sseldorf on 19th and 20th November.  
If you&#8217;re attending too just say &#8220;hi&#8221;, I&#8217;m looking forward to it.

I already know that [Hans Christian Reinl][1], [Andreas Dantz][2] and [Nils Riedemann][3] will be there and am happy meeting them.
