**So before I&#8217;m off to DÃ¼sseldorf for beyond tellerrand 2014, I have another Weekly Recap for you. Enjoy!**

  * [Should you use HTML5 header and footer?][1]  
    Bruce Lawson explains if, why and when you should use HTML5 elements like header and footer.
  * [Font Size Idea: px at the Root, rem for Components, em for Text Elements][2]  
    This article is actually over a month old but it&#8217;s a great idea by Chris Coyier how to handle font sizes. Would like to try this out in a real project.
  * [Don&#8217;t Wait on Responsive Images][3]  
    Tim Kadlec about the state of responsive images solutions. What we&#8217;ve got and what else we want. Also, it&#8217;s already pretty good compared to half a year ago.
  * [Tablesaw][4]  
    A set of plugins for responsive tables by the awesome Filament Group.
  * [Pragmatic, simple tooltip][5]  
    By Harry Roberts. No Javascript required.
  * [Building the Carousel website with Dropbox][6]  
    Jonnie Hallman tells the story of how he build the Dropbox Carousel one-pager.
  * [Parallax Done Right][7]  
    Dave Gamache, Designer from Medium about what you should and shouldn&#8217;t do when building parallax sites. Good addition to the aforementioned article about Carousel.
  * [Writing is hard. Let&#8217;s go shopping.][8]  
    Some tips from Addy Osmani to improve your technical writing skills.
  * [Why Developers Need to Learn Design][9]  
    A lot of good points by Stephen Caver why it&#8217;s good to get a basic understanding of and feel for design.
