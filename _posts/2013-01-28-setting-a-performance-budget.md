> A performance budget is just what it sounds like: you set a “budget” on your page and do not allow the page to exceed that. This may be a specific load time, but it is usually an easier conversation to have when you break the budget down into the number of requests or size of the page.

I like the idea of having a performance budget to force you to think more about the implementation of every feature and every asset.
