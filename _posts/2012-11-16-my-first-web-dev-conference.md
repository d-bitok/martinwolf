As I said some time ago I will attend [beyond tellerrand conference][1] in Düsseldorf next monday and tuesday. As it turns out I&#8217;ll already be in town sunday evening and so maybe I&#8217;ll also be at the [warmup][2].

It&#8217;s my first web development conference and I&#8217;m really excited to hear great talks and meet new awesome people. So if you&#8217;re also attending make sure to say &#8220;hi&#8221;. :)
