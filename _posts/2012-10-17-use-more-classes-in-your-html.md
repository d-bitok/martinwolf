> Imagine a classroom full of children with no names. In order to organise and refer to them the teacher has a system; the guy two rows from the back, the kid next to the girl next to the kid under the light, the girl near the window, the first guy sat in the carpeted area…
> 
> Her seating plan reads like a board game. As soon as the guy next to the window swaps places with the girl next to the radiator then she has to remember that it’s now the guy near the window, and that the girl near the guy near the window is now near the girl near the window.
> 
> As soon as anything moves or changes she has to do a lot of rethinking and making sure things still check out. If the guy near the door is now the guy under the AC unit then is that definitely the right girl next to the guy who used to be the girl under the AC unit? Who knows?

I love this analogy. Brilliant. :D

Sure, there is still the need for selectors like `last-child` or `nth-of-type`. But I&#8217;m on Harrys side that we need to start changing our default behavior. It makes so much more sense, especially when working on big projects or ones that change a lot.
