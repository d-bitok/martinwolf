**Since we use GitHub at [QUOTE.fm][1] I love it so much that I want to use it for everything. It&#8217;s so simple and so great. But because I haven&#8217;t got a paid account at the moment I can only use public repositories.  
**  
While I was building TheAmazingWeb.net I decided that I wanted to put it up on GitHub so that I have version control and another backup and all the other cool things. I wanted to upgrade my account so that I can have private repos but then I thought that it might actually be really cool to just make everything public.

It&#8217;s a great way to follow me developing this site. You can see every tiny bit of code I write, every [commit][2]. Take away what you need or tell me if I&#8217;m doing something stupid. I hope that nobody copies my theme exactly but basically everything&#8217;s free to use.  
If you have any questions regarding any code or find bugs please let me know and I try to fix them as quickly as possible.

Ah, I almost forgot. You can find me on GitHub as [martinwolf][3] and the repo of TheAmazingWeb.net [here][4].

And don&#8217;t forget to subscribe to the [RSS Feed][5] or just follow [TAW_net][6] on Twitter to always stay up to date.
