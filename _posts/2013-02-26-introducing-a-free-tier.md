> To get access to the App.net free tier, you must have an invite. These invites are being distributed to current App.net members on paid plans.

> Free tier accounts are similar to paid tier accounts, but with a few limitations. These limitations are as follows:
> 
> Free tier accounts can follow a maximum of 40 users
> 
> Free tier accounts have 500 MB of available file storage
> 
> Free tier accounts can upload a file with a maximum size of 10 MB

So App.net is a freemium service now. And since I logged in last time the design actually got nice. So if you want to get in, I have five invites left. Just leave a comment here. And if you already have an account, you might want to follow me in case I start using it regularly: <https://alpha.app.net/martinwolf>

I wonder how long you even need an invite to get in. I think some day they will also drop that. But that&#8217;s just guessing.
