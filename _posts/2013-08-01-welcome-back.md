As it turns out, I really like this blog and miss posting here. One of my reasons for pausing was so that I can focus more on other things. While this was a great idea I still read the same amount of articles and try new things, but now no one besides me benefits from it. And above all TheAmazingWeb is here to help you and I want to give back to the web developer community in any way I can.

Sometimes you have to take a step back or quit something entirely to understand what it means to you.

Welcome back to The Amazing Web!
