MG Siegler argues that every startup should focus on mobile apps first instead of the desktop/laptop-based web.

And I say that if you build a website first you definitely need to make it responsive as fast as possible.  
I think this doesn&#8217;t only apply to startups with cool services but also to every other website. The mobile web is already very big and gets bigger and faster every day. So make yourself comfortable with crafting responsive websites. It&#8217;s the future, don&#8217;t miss it.
