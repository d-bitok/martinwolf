> Here’s a collection of videos that I’ve stumbled across in recent months.

Louis of ImpressiveWebs has curated a fine list of ten conference videos for Front End Developers. I&#8217;ve already seen two or three of them and am looking forward to the rest.  
At the moment the Smashing Conference is running and I hope they are recording all the talks because I&#8217;m a little bit sad that I didn&#8217;t go and it seems to be pretty good. But watching the videos online is mostly a good experience, too.
