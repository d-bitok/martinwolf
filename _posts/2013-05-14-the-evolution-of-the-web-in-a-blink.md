> Firefox intentionally removing support for the <blink> element draws a hard line demarcating the end of a wildly popular primitive Web animation which preceded today’s streaming videos and humorous GIFs. The change may be bittersweet for a certain weird variety of Internet nostalgist, but in most other senses it’s probably for the best: it’s a fantastically annoying bit of code and shouldn’t exist at all.

Great article on the history of the `<blink>` tag and the browsers that supported it.
