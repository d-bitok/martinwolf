> The first beta of Sublime Text 3 is now available to download for registered users. Some feature highlights are below, followed by our new pricing and upgrade policies, and system compatibility for Sublime Text 3.

The first beta of Sublime Text 3 is available for users with a license key for ST2.  
The current version is so good that I really don&#8217;t know what can get better for me personally. The improvements in the beta aren&#8217;t really of significance for me. But let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s coming.
