> Early this month, it was my pleasure to attend a presentation by Al Urim and Jeff Morrison from Facebook’s mobile web team at Sid Maestre‘s Bay Area Mobile meeting in which they share their experiences maintaining Facebook’s mobile website. I thought they’re be enough interest in the topic to post my notes publicly; hope you find them useful.

Interesting look behind the scenes of the Facebook mobile website team.
