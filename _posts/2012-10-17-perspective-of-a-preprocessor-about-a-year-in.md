> CSS preprocessing makes CSS fun again. If you write enough plain CSS, it wears on you. I absolutely love the power of CSS. I love working with CSS. I love making things with CSS. But I tire of all the tedious stuff. I want to work faster and more efficiently. Thats what CSS preprocessors really do. The have made working with CSS rewarding to me again and thats why they matter.

Today Chris Coyier and David Walsh have a cross posting thing going on. Chris wrote an article about CSS preprocessors after one year of usage and David Walsh wrote about his [first experience with SASS][1]. Both articles are worth a read, have fun.
