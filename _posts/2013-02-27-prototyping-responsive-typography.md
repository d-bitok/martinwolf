> Basically, a typography prototype is a single web page that consists of the project’s actual content. It’s designed in the browser using real web fonts and tools like Typecast. A typography prototype includes font choices, styles for the basic text content and a typographic scale, but nothing else.

The process of building out a responsive typography prototype is definitely a great idea and the optimum when it comes to web typography in a multi device context, but I doubt that many web designers actually do something like this.
