> Subversion gives you time to socialize when creating a branch, checkout a branch or even switch beween branches. You get some time to chat with co-workers, go to the kitchen and grap a cup of coffee or to write comments on facebook. Git changes the game for the worse: Due to the fact that you working just on your hard disk to do all this tasks in Git, it is faster and you lose the natural social time.

Had a fun time reading this. Especially because at my current job I have to use SVN and was used to Git before. ([via][1])
