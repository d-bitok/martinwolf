> Today, a cross-vendor collection of developers, led by Google, is open-sourcing RoboHornet. As project lead Alex Komoroske put it, “it’s a living, dynamic benchmark that aims to use the collective efforts of the web development community and ultimately get browser vendors to fix real-world performance pain points.” Let’s look at how RoboHornet will hopefully flip the above situation on its head.

I&#8217;m not the biggest javascript developer and mainly get away with jQuery, but RoboHornet sounds very good to me. Hope it gains traction.
