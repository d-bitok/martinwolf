  Harry Roberts:
</p>

> I want to work with talented teams – working on amazing products – all across the globe. I want to work with nice people who care as much about building great things as I do, and having fun in the process. I want people who take their work, but not themselves, seriously. I want to work with you.

Today is Harrys last day at Sky and from now on you can and should work with him. All the best for you, Harry!
