<!--more-->

  * [My Secrets To Becoming A Successful Freelancer][1]Good tips for everyone who&#8217;s just starting out, like me, or wants to make the jump.
  * [How To Be A Great Developer][2]  
    Not sure if I posted this link before, but it&#8217;s a really good one.
  * [Laura Kalbag on Freelance Design: I Don’t Like It][3]How you can get valuable feedback out of clients.
  * [“Native experience” vs styling select boxes][4]  
    Bruce Lawson asks why we want to style native form elements. Do you have the answer?
  * [iTerm2 2.0 Released][5]  
    Stable 2.0 of my favourite command line app was released.
  * [New GitHub for Mac][6]  
    GitHub revamped their Mac app. And it&#8217;s now possible to add non-GitHub repos if you set the remote manually in the &#8216;Settings&#8217; view. I&#8217;ll keep on using the command line though.
  * [M dot or RWD. Which is faster?][7]  
    Interesting read and I&#8217;d say that the result would be even clearer with a newer data set since more and more people acknowledge performance as a feature.
  * [How to create the illusion of faster web pages][8]  
    And thus create happier users.
  * [Inheriting box-sizing Probably Slightly Better Best-Practice][9]  
    Good idea by Chris Coyier, although I&#8217;m not 100% sold because it creates more trouble and code if you actually only want to change box-sizing on one element and not on the children of said element, which is want I needed a few times. But for the case Chris&#8217; describes, his approach is nice.
  * [New Can I Use Design][10]  
    Recently I reported, that the new Can I Use Design was up as a beta site and now it&#8217;s released for everybody on the live site. Nice! I also recommend checking the settings.
  * [Hacks for dealing with specificity][11]  
    As always helpful CSS tips from Harry Roberts. Especially the last one will help me a lot.
