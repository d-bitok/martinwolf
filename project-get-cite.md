Cite is a project by my good friends Marcel Wichmann and Florian Albrecht. The iOS app allows you to share beautiful textshots with your Twitter followers to recommend articles worth reading.

Together with Marcel, who was responsible for the screendesign, I built a one-pager landing page for them.
